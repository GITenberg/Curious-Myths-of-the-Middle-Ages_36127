<p class="center xlrgfont">MEDI&AElig;VAL MYTHS.</p>



<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>The Wandering Jew.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HO, that has looked on Gustave Dor&eacute;&rsquo;s marvellous
illustrations to this wild legend, can
forget the impression they made upon his imagination?</p>

<p>I do not refer to the first illustration as striking,
where the Jewish shoemaker is refusing to suffer
the cross-laden Savior to rest a moment on his
door-step, and is receiving with scornful lip the
judgment to wander restless till the Second Coming
of that same Redeemer. But I refer rather to the
second, which represents the Jew, after the lapse
of ages, bowed beneath the burden of the curse,
worn with unrelieved toil, wearied with ceaseless
travelling, trudging onward at the last lights of
evening, when a rayless night of unabating rain is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
creeping on, along a sloppy path between dripping
bushes; and suddenly he comes over against a wayside
crucifix, on which the white glare of departing
daylight falls, to throw it into ghastly relief against
the pitch-black rain-clouds. For a moment we see
the working of the miserable shoemaker&rsquo;s mind.
We feel that he is recalling the tragedy of the first
Good Friday, and his head hangs heavier on his
breast, as he recalls the part he had taken in that
awful catastrophe.</p>

<p>Or, is that other illustration more remarkable,
where the wanderer is amongst the Alps, at the
brink of a hideous chasm; and seeing in the contorted
pine-branches the ever-haunting scene of
the Via Dolorosa, he is lured to cast himself into
that black gulf in quest of rest,&mdash;when an angel
flashes out of the gloom with the sword of flame
turning every way, keeping him back from what
would be to him a Paradise indeed, the repose of
Death?</p>

<p>Or, that last scene, when the trumpet sounds
and earth is shivering to its foundations, the fire
is bubbling forth through the rents in its surface,
and the dead are coming together flesh to flesh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
and bone to bone, and muscle to muscle&mdash;then
the weary man sits down and casts off his shoes!
Strange sights are around him, he sees them not;
strange sounds assail his ears, he hears but one&mdash;the
trumpet-note which gives the signal for him to
stay his wanderings and rest his weary feet.</p>

<p>I can linger over those noble woodcuts, and learn
from them something new each time that I study
them; they are picture-poems full of latent depths
of thought. And now let us to the history of this
most thrilling of all medi&aelig;val myths, if a myth.</p>

<p>If a myth, I say, for who can say for certain that
it is not true? &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, There
be some standing here, which shall not taste of
death till they see the Son of Man coming in His
kingdom,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are our Lord&rsquo;s words, which I can
hardly think apply to the destruction of Jerusalem,
as commentators explain it to escape the difficulty.
That some should live to see Jerusalem destroyed
was not very surprising, and hardly needed the
emphatic Verily which Christ only used when
speaking something of peculiarly solemn or mysterious
import.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
Besides, St. Luke&rsquo;s account manifestly refers the
coming in the kingdom to the Judgment, for the
saying stands as follows: &ldquo;Whosoever shall be
ashamed of Me, and of My words, of him shall
the Son of Man be ashamed, when He shall come
in His own glory, and in His Father&rsquo;s, and of the
holy angels. But I tell you of a truth, there be
some standing here, which shall not taste of death
till they see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>There can, I think, be no doubt in the mind of
an unprejudiced person that the words of our Lord
do imply that some one or more of those then
living should not die till He came again. I do not
mean to insist on the literal signification, but I
plead that there is no improbability in our Lord&rsquo;s
words being fulfilled to the letter. That the circumstance
is unrecorded in the Gospels is no
evidence that it did not take place, for we are
expressly told, &ldquo;Many other signs truly did Jesus
in the presence of His disciples, which are not
written in this book;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and again, &ldquo;There are
also many other things which Jesus did, the which,
if they should be written every one, I suppose that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
even the world itself could not contain the books
that should be written.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>We may remember also the mysterious witnesses
who are to appear in the last eventful days of the
world&rsquo;s history and bear testimony to the Gospel
truth before the antichristian world. One of these
has been often conjectured to be St. John the
Evangelist, of whom Christ said to Peter, &ldquo;If
I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to
thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The historical evidence on which the tale rests
is, however, too slender for us to admit for it more
than the barest claim to be more than myth. The
names and the circumstances connected with the
Jew and his doom vary in every account, and the
only point upon which all coincide is, that such an
individual exists in an undying condition, wandering
over the face of the earth, seeking rest and
finding none.</p>

<p>The earliest extant mention of the Wandering
Jew is to be found in the book of the chronicles
of the Abbey of St. Albans, which was copied and
continued by Matthew Paris. He records that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
the year 1228, &ldquo;a certain Archbishop of Armenia
the Greater came on a pilgrimage to England to
see the relics of the saints, and visit the sacred
places in the kingdom, as he had done in others;
he also produced letters of recommendation from
his Holiness the Pope, to the religious and the
prelates of the churches, in which they were enjoined
to receive and entertain him with due reverence
and honor. On his arrival, he came to St.
Albans, where he was received with all respect
by the abbot and the monks; and at this place,
being fatigued with his journey, he remained some
days to rest himself and his followers, and a conversation
took place between him and the inhabitants
of the convent, by means of their interpreters,
during which he made many inquiries relating to
the religion and religious observances of this country,
and told many strange things concerning the
countries of the East. In the course of conversation
he was asked whether he had ever seen or
heard any thing of Joseph, a man of whom there
was much talk in the world, who, when our Lord
suffered, was present and spoke to Him, and who
is still alive, in evidence of the Christian faith; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
reply to which, a knight in his retinue, who was
his interpreter, replied, speaking in French, &lsquo;My
lord well knows that man, and a little before he
took his way to the western countries, the said
Joseph ate at the table of my lord the Archbishop
of Armenia, and he has often seen and conversed
with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was then asked about what had passed between
Christ and the said Joseph; to which he
replied, &lsquo;At the time of the passion of Jesus Christ,
He was seized by the Jews, and led into the hall
of judgment before Pilate, the governor, that He
might be judged by him on the accusation of the
Jews; and Pilate, finding no fault for which he
might sentence Him to death, said unto them,
&ldquo;Take Him and judge Him according to your
law;&rdquo; the shouts of the Jews, however, increasing,
he, at their request, released unto them Barabbas,
and delivered Jesus to them to be crucified. When,
therefore, the Jews were dragging Jesus forth, and
had reached the door, Cartaphilus, a porter of the
hall in Pilate&rsquo;s service, as Jesus was going out of
the door, impiously struck Him on the back with
his hand, and said in mockery, &ldquo;Go quicker,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
Jesus, go quicker; why do you loiter?&rdquo; and Jesus,
looking back on him with a severe countenance,
said to him, &ldquo;I am going, and you shall wait till
I return.&rdquo; And according as our Lord said, this
Cartaphilus is still awaiting His return. At the
time of our Lord&rsquo;s suffering he was thirty years
old, and when he attains the age of a hundred
years, he always returns to the same age as he
was when our Lord suffered. After Christ&rsquo;s death,
when the Catholic faith gained ground, this Cartaphilus
was baptized by Ananias (who also baptized
the Apostle Paul), and was called Joseph. He
dwells in one or other divisions of Armenia, and in
divers Eastern countries, passing his time amongst
the bishops and other prelates of the Church; he
is a man of holy conversation, and religious; a
man of few words, and very circumspect in his
behavior; for he does not speak at all unless
when questioned by the bishops and religious;
and then he relates the events of olden times, and
speaks of things which occurred at the suffering
and resurrection of our Lord, and of the witnesses
of the resurrection, namely, of those who
rose with Christ, and went into the holy city, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
appeared unto men. He also tells of the creed of
the Apostles, and of their separation and preaching.
And all this he relates without smiling, or
levity of conversation, as one who is well practised
in sorrow and the fear of God, always looking forward
with dread to the coming of Jesus Christ, lest
at the Last Judgment he should find him in anger
whom, when on his way to death, he had provoked
to just vengeance. Numbers came to him from different
parts of the world, enjoying his society and
conversation; and to them, if they are men of authority,
he explains all doubts on the matters on which he
is questioned. He refuses all gifts that are offered
him, being content with slight food and clothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much about the same date, Philip Mouskes, afterwards
Bishop of Tournay, wrote his rhymed chronicle
(1242), which contains a similar account of the
Jew, derived from the same Armenian prelate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Adonques vint un arceveskes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">De &ccedil;&agrave; mer, plains de bonnes t&egrave;ques<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Par samblant, et fut d&rsquo;Armenie,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and this man, having visited the shrine of &ldquo;St.
Tumas de Kantorbire,&rdquo; and then having paid his
devotions at &ldquo;Monsigour St. Jake,&rdquo; he went on to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
Cologne to see the heads of the three kings. The
version told in the Netherlands much resembled that
related at St. Albans, only that the Jew, seeing the
people dragging Christ to his death, exclaims,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Atend&eacute;s moi! g&rsquo;i vois,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">S&rsquo;iert mis le faus prof&egrave;te en crois.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Le vrais Dieux se regarda,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et li a dit qu&rsquo;e n&rsquo;i tarda,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Icist ne t&rsquo;atenderont pas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mais saces, tu m&rsquo;atenderas.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We hear no more of the wandering Jew till the
sixteenth century, when we hear first of him in a
casual manner, as assisting a weaver, Kokot, at the
royal palace in Bohemia (1505), to find a treasure
which had been secreted by the great-grandfather of
Kokot, sixty years before, at which time the Jew was
present. He then had the appearance of being a
man of seventy years.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough, we next hear of him in the
East, where he is confounded with the prophet
Elijah. Early in the century he appeared to Fadhilah,
under peculiar circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
After the Arabs had captured the city of Elvan,
Fadhilah, at the head of three hundred horsemen,
pitched his tents, late in the evening, between two
mountains. Fadhilah, having begun his evening
prayer with a loud voice, heard the words &ldquo;Allah
akbar&rdquo; (God is great) repeated distinctly, and each
word of his prayer was followed in a similar manner.
Fadhilah, not believing this to be the result
of an echo, was much astonished, and cried out,
&ldquo;O thou! whether thou art of the angel ranks, or
whether thou art of some other order of spirits, it is
well; the power of God be with thee; but if thou
art a man, then let mine eyes light upon thee, that I
may rejoice in thy presence and society.&rdquo; Scarcely
had he spoken these words, before an aged man,
with bald head, stood before him, holding a staff in
his hand, and much resembling a dervish in appearance.
After having courteously saluted him, Fadhilah
asked the old man who he was. Thereupon the
stranger answered, &ldquo;Bassi Hadhret Issa, I am here
by command of the Lord Jesus, who has left me in
this world, that I may live therein until he comes a
second time to earth. I wait for this Lord, who is
the Fountain of Happiness, and in obedience to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
command I dwell behind yon mountain.&rdquo; When
Fadhilah heard these words, he asked when the Lord
Jesus would appear; and the old man replied that his
appearing would be at the end of the world, at the
Last Judgment. But this only increased Fadhilah&rsquo;s
curiosity, so that he inquired the signs of the approach
of the end of all things, whereupon Zerib Bar Elia
gave him an account of general, social, and moral
dissolution, which would be the climax of this
world&rsquo;s history.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In 1547 he was seen in Europe, if we are to believe
the following narration:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul von Eitzen, doctor of the Holy Scriptures,
and Bishop of Schleswig,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> related as true for some
years past, that when he was young, having studied
at Wittemberg, he returned home to his parents in
Hamburg in the winter of the year 1547, and that on
the following Sunday, in church, he observed a tall
man, with his hair hanging over his shoulders, standing
barefoot, during the sermon, over against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
pulpit, listening with deepest attention to the discourse,
and, whenever the name of Jesus was mentioned,
bowing himself profoundly and humbly, with
sighs and beating of the breast. He had no other
clothing, in the bitter cold of the winter, except a pair
of hose which were in tatters about his feet, and a
coat with a girdle which reached to his feet; and his
general appearance was that of a man of fifty years.
And many people, some of high degree and title,
have seen this same man in England, France, Italy,
Hungary, Persia, Spain, Poland, Moscow, Lapland,
Sweden, Denmark, Scotland, and other places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one wondered over the man. Now, after
the sermon, the said Doctor inquired diligently where
the stranger was to be found; and when he had
sought him out, he inquired of him privately whence
he came, and how long that winter he had been in
the place. Thereupon he replied, modestly, that he
was a Jew by birth, a native of Jerusalem, by name
Ahasverus, by trade a shoemaker; he had been present
at the crucifixion of Christ, and had lived ever
since, travelling through various lands and cities, the
which he substantiated by accounts he gave; he
related also the circumstances of Christ&rsquo;s transference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
from Pilate to Herod, and the final crucifixion,
together with other details not recorded in the
Evangelists and historians; he gave accounts of the
changes of government in many countries, especially
of the East, through several centuries; and moreover
he detailed the labors and deaths of the holy Apostles
of Christ most circumstantially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now when Doctor Paul v. Eitzen heard this with
profound astonishment, on account of its incredible
novelty, he inquired further, in order that he might
obtain more accurate information. Then the man
answered, that he had lived in Jerusalem at the time
of the crucifixion of Christ, whom he had regarded as
a deceiver of the people, and a heretic; he had seen
Him with his own eyes, and had done his best, along
with others, to bring this deceiver, as he regarded
Him, to justice, and to have Him put out of the way.
When the sentence had been pronounced by Pilate,
Christ was about to be dragged past his house; then
he ran home, and called together his household to have
a look at Christ, and see what sort of a person He was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This having been done, he had his little child on
his arm, and was standing in his doorway, to have a
sight of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
&ldquo;As, then, Christ was led by, bowed under the
weight of the heavy cross, He tried to rest a little, and
stood still a moment; but the shoemaker, in zeal and
rage, and for the sake of obtaining credit among the
other Jews, drove the Lord Christ forward, and told
Him to hasten on His way. Jesus, obeying, looked at
him, and said, &lsquo;I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt
go till the last day.&rsquo; At these words the man set down
the child; and, unable to remain where he was, he
followed Christ, and saw how cruelly He was crucified,
how He suffered, how He died. As soon as this
had taken place, it came upon him suddenly that he
could no more return to Jerusalem, nor see again his
wife and child, but must go forth into foreign lands,
one after another, like a mournful pilgrim. Now,
when, years after, he returned to Jerusalem, he found
it ruined and utterly razed, so that not one stone was
left standing on another; and he could not recognize
former localities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He believes that it is God&rsquo;s purpose, in thus
driving him about in miserable life, and preserving
him undying, to present him before the Jews at the
end, as a living token, so that the godless and unbelieving
may remember the death of Christ, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
turned to repentance. For his part he would well
rejoice were God in heaven to release him from this
vale of tears. After this conversation, Doctor Paul v.
Eitzen, along with the rector of the school of Hamburg,
who was well read in history, and a traveller,
questioned him about events which had taken place
in the East since the death of Christ, and he was able
to give them much information on many ancient
matters; so that it was impossible not to be convinced
of the truth of his story, and to see that what seems
impossible with men is, after all, possible with God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the Jew has had his life extended, he has
become silent and reserved, and only answers direct
questions. When invited to become any one&rsquo;s guest,
he eats little, and drinks in great moderation; then
hurries on, never remaining long in one place.
When at Hamburg, Dantzig, and elsewhere, money
has been offered him, he never took more than two
skillings (fourpence, one farthing), and at once distributed
it to the poor, as token that he needed no money,
for God would provide for him, as he rued the sins
he had committed in ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the period of his stay in Hamburg and
Dantzig he was never seen to laugh. In whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
land he travelled he spoke its language, and when
he spoke Saxon, it was like a native Saxon. Many
people came from different places to Hamburg and
Dantzig in order to see and hear this man, and were
convinced that the providence of God was exercised
in this individual in a very remarkable manner. He
gladly listened to God&rsquo;s word, or heard it spoken of
always with great gravity and compunction, and he
ever reverenced with sighs the pronunciation of the
name of God, or of Jesus Christ, and could not endure
to hear curses; but whenever he heard any one swear
by God&rsquo;s death or pains, he waxed indignant, and exclaimed,
with vehemence and with sighs, &lsquo;Wretched
man and miserable creature, thus to misuse the name
of thy Lord and God, and His bitter sufferings and
passion. Hadst thou seen, as I have, how heavy and
bitter were the pangs and wounds of thy Lord, endured
for thee and for me, thou wouldst rather undergo
great pain thyself than thus take His sacred name
in vain!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the account given to me by Doctor Paul
von Eitzen, with many circumstantial proofs, and
corroborated by certain of my own old acquaintances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
who saw this same individual with their own
eyes in Hamburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the year 1575 the Secretary Christopher
Krause, and Master Jacob von Holstein, legates to
the Court of Spain, and afterwards sent into the
Netherlands to pay the soldiers serving his Majesty
in that country, related on their return home to
Schleswig, and confirmed with solemn oaths, that
they had come across the same mysterious individual
at Madrid in Spain, in appearance, manner of life,
habits, clothing, just the same as he had appeared in
Hamburg. They said that they had spoken with
him, and that many people of all classes had conversed
with him, and found him to speak good Spanish.
In the year 1599, in December, a reliable person
wrote from Brunswick to Strasburg that the same
mentioned strange person had been seen alive at
Vienna in Austria, and that he had started for Poland
and Dantzig; and that he purposed going on to Moscow.
This Ahasverus was at Lubeck in 1601, also
about the same date in Revel in Livonia, and in
Cracow in Poland. In Moscow he was seen of many
and spoken to by many.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What thoughtful, God-fearing persons are to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
of the said person, is at their option. God&rsquo;s works
are wondrous and past finding out, and are manifested
day by day, only to be revealed in full at the last great
day of account.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Dated, Revel, August 1st, 1613.<br />
&ldquo;D.&nbsp;W.<br />
&ldquo;D.<br />
&ldquo;Chrysostomus Dudul&oelig;us,<br />
<span class="padleft">&ldquo;Westphalus.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The statement that the Wandering Jew appeared
in Lubeck in 1601, does not tally with the more precise
chronicle of Henricus Bangert, which gives:
&ldquo;Die 14 Januarii Anno MDCIII., adnotatum reliquit
Lubec&aelig; fuisse Jud&aelig;um illum immortalem, qui se
Christi crucifixioni interfuisse affirmavit.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In 1604 he seems to have appeared in Paris. Rudolph
Botoreus says, under this date, &ldquo;I fear lest I be
accused of giving ear to old wives&rsquo; fables, if I insert
in these pages what is reported all over Europe of
the Jew, coeval with the Savior Christ; however,
nothing is more common, and our popular histories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
have not scrupled to assert it. Following the lead
of those who wrote our annals, I may say that he
who appeared not in one century only, in Spain,
Italy, and Germany, was also in this year seen and
recognized as the same individual who had appeared
in Hamburg, anno MDLXVI. The common people,
bold in spreading reports, relate many things of him;
and this I allude to, lest anything should be left
unsaid.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>J.&nbsp;C. Bulenger puts the date of the Hamburg visit
earlier. &ldquo;It was reported at this time that a Jew of
the time of Christ was wandering without food and
drink, having for a thousand and odd years been a
vagabond and outcast, condemned by God to rove,
because he, of that generation of vipers, was the first
to cry out for the crucifixion of Christ and the release
of Barabbas; and also because soon after, when
Christ, panting under the burden of the rood, sought
to rest before his workshop (he was a cobbler), the
fellow ordered Him off with acerbity. Thereupon
Christ replied, &lsquo;Because thou grudgest Me such a
moment of rest, I shall enter into My rest, but thou
shalt wander restless.&rsquo; At once, frantic and agitated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
he fled through the whole earth, and on the same
account to this day he journeys through the world.
It was this person who was seen in Hamburg in
MDLXIV. Credat Jud&aelig;us Apella! <em>I</em> did not see
him, or hear anything authentic concerning him, at
that time when I was in Paris.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A curious little book,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> written against the quackery
of Paracelsus, by Leonard Doldius, a N&uuml;rnberg physician,
and translated into Latin and augmented, by
Andreas Libavius, doctor and physician of Rotenburg,
alludes to the same story, and gives the Jew a
new name nowhere else met with. After having
referred to a report that Paracelsus was not dead, but
was seated alive, asleep or napping, in his sepulchre
at Strasburg, preserved from death by some of his
specifics, Libavius declares that he would sooner believe
in the old man, the Jew, Ahasverus, wandering
over the world, called by some Buttad&aelig;us, and otherwise,
again, by others.</p>

<p>He is said to have appeared in Naumburg, but
the date is not given; he was noticed in church,
listening to the sermon. After the service he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
questioned, and he related his story. On this occasion
he received presents from the burgers.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In 1633
he was again in Hamburg.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In the year 1640, two
citizens, living in the Gerberstrasse, in Brussels, were
walking in the Sonian wood, when they encountered
an aged man, whose clothes were in tatters and of
an antiquated appearance. They invited him to go
with them to a house of refreshment, and he went
with them, but would not seat himself, remaining on
foot to drink. When he came before the doors with
the two burgers, he told them a great deal; but they
were mostly stories of events which had happened
many hundred years before. Hence the burgers
gathered that their companion was Isaac Laquedem,
the Jew who had refused to permit our Blessed Lord
to rest for a moment at his door-step, and they left him
full of terror. In 1642 he is reported to have visited
Leipzig. On the 22d July, 1721, he appeared at the
gates of the city of Munich.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> About the end of the
seventeenth century or the beginning of the eighteenth,
an impostor, calling himself the Wandering Jew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
attracted attention in England, and was listened to by
the ignorant, and despised by the educated. He,
however, managed to thrust himself into the notice
of the nobility, who, half in jest, half in curiosity,
questioned him, and paid him as they might a juggler.
He declared that he had been an officer of the Sanhedrim,
and that he had struck Christ as he left the
judgment hall of Pilate. He remembered all the
Apostles, and described their personal appearance,
their clothes, and their peculiarities. He spoke many
languages, claimed the power of healing the sick,
and asserted that he had travelled nearly all over the
world. Those who heard him were perplexed by his
familiarity with foreign tongues and places. Oxford
and Cambridge sent professors to question him, and
to discover the imposition, if any. An English nobleman
conversed with him in Arabic. The mysterious
stranger told his questioner in that language that
historical works were not to be relied upon. And
on being asked his opinion of Mahomet, he replied
that he had been acquainted with the father of the
prophet, and that he dwelt at Ormuz. As for
Mahomet, he believed him to have been a man of
intelligence; once when he heard the prophet deny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
that Christ was crucified, he answered abruptly by
telling him he was a witness to the truth of that
event. He related also that he was in Rome when
Nero set it on fire; he had known Saladin, Tamerlane,
Bajazeth, Eterlane, and could give minute
details of the history of the Crusades.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Whether this wandering Jew was found out in
London or not, we cannot tell, but he shortly after
appeared in Denmark, thence travelled into Sweden,
and vanished.</p>

<p>Such are the principal notices of the Wandering
Jew which have appeared. It will be seen at once
how wanting they are in all substantial evidence
which could make us regard the story in any other
light than myth.</p>

<p>But no myth is wholly without foundation, and
there must be some substantial verity upon which
this vast superstructure of legend has been raised.
What that is I am unable to discover.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by some that the Jew
Ahasverus is an impersonation of that race which
wanders, Cain-like, over the earth with the brand
of a brother&rsquo;s blood upon it, and one which is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
to pass away till all be fulfilled, not to be reconciled
to its angered God till the times of the Gentiles
are accomplished. And yet, probable as this supposition
may seem at first sight, it is not to be harmonized
with some of the leading features of the
story. The shoemaker becomes a penitent, and
earnest Christian, whilst the Jewish nation has still
the veil upon its heart; the wretched wanderer eschews
money, and the avarice of the Israelite is
proverbial.</p>

<p>According to local legend, he is identified with
the Gypsies, or rather that strange people are supposed
to be living under a curse somewhat similar
to that inflicted on Ahasverus, because they refused
shelter to the Virgin and Child on their flight into
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Another tradition connects the Jew with
the wild huntsman, and there is a forest at Bretten,
in Swabia, which he is said to haunt. Popular
superstition attributes to him there a purse containing
a groschen, which, as often as it is expended,
returns to the spender.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In the Harz one form of the Wild Huntsman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
myth is to this effect: that he was a Jew who had
refused to suffer our Blessed Lord to drink out of
a river, or out of a horse-trough, but had contemptuously
pointed out to Him the hoof-print of a horse,
in which a little water had collected, and had bid
Him quench His thirst thence.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>As the Wild Huntsman is the personification of
the storm, it is curious to find in parts of France
that the sudden roar of a gale at night is attributed
by the vulgar to the passing of the Everlasting Jew.</p>

<p>A Swiss story is, that he was seen one day standing
upon the Matterberg, which is below the
Matterhorn, contemplating the scene with mingled
sorrow and wonder. Once before he stood on that
spot, and then it was the site of a flourishing city;
now it is covered with gentian and wild pinks.
Once again will he revisit the hill, and that will be
on the eve of Judgment.</p>

<p>Perhaps, of all the myths which originated in the
middle ages, none is more striking than that we
have been considering; indeed, there is something
so calculated to arrest the attention and to excite
the imagination in the outline of the story, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
is remarkable that we should find an interval of
three centuries elapse between its first introduction
into Europe by Matthew Paris and Philip Mouskes,
and its general acceptance in the sixteenth century.
As a myth, its roots lie in that great mystery of
human life which is an enigma never solved, and
ever originating speculation.</p>

<p>What was life? Was it of necessity limited to
fourscore years, or could it be extended indefinitely?
were questions curious minds never wearied of asking.
And so the mythology of the past teemed
with legends of favored or accursed mortals, who
had reached beyond the term of days set to most
men. Some had discovered the water of life, the
fountain of perpetual youth, and were ever renewing
their strength. Others had dared the power of
God, and were therefore sentenced to feel the weight
of His displeasure, without tasting the repose of
death.</p>

<p>John the Divine slept at Ephesus, untouched by
corruption, with the ground heaving over his breast
as he breathed, waiting the summons to come forth
and witness against Antichrist. The seven sleepers
reposed in a cave, and centuries glided by like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
watch in the night. The monk of Hildesheim,
doubting how with God a thousand years could be
as yesterday, listened to the melody of a bird in
the green wood during three minutes, and found
that in three minutes three hundred years had flown.
Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, in the blessed city of Sarras,
draws perpetual life from the Saint Graal; Merlin
sleeps and sighs in an old tree, spell-bound of Vivien.
Charlemagne and Barbarossa wait, crowned and
armed, in the heart of the mountain, till the time
comes for the release of Fatherland from despotism.
And, on the other hand, the curse of a deathless
life has passed on the Wild Huntsman, because he
desired to chase the red-deer for evermore; on the
Captain of the Phantom Ship, because he vowed he
would double the Cape whether God willed it or
not; on the Man in the Moon, because he gathered
sticks during the Sabbath rest; on the dancers of
Kolbeck, because they desired to spend eternity in
their mad gambols.</p>

<p>I began this article intending to conclude it with
a bibliographical account of the tracts, letters, essays,
and books, written upon the Wandering Jew; but
I relinquish my intention at the sight of the multitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
of works which have issued from the press
upon the subject; and this I do with less compunction
as the bibliographer may at little trouble and
expense satisfy himself, by perusing the lists given
by Gr&auml;sse in his essay on the myth, and those to be
found in &ldquo;Notice historique et bibliographique sur
les Juifs-errants: par O.&nbsp;B.&rdquo; (Gustave Brunet), Paris,
T&eacute;chener, 1845; also in the article by M. Mangin,
in &ldquo;Causeries et M&eacute;ditations historiques et litt&eacute;raires,&rdquo;
Paris, Duprat, 1843; and, lastly, in the essay
by Jacob le Bibliophile (M. Lacroix) in his &ldquo;Curiosit&eacute;s
de l&rsquo;Histoire des Croyances populaires,&rdquo; Paris,
Delahays, 1859.</p>

<p>Of the romances of Eug&egrave;ne Sue and Dr. Croly,
founded upon the legend, the less said the better.
The original legend is so noble in its severe simplicity,
that none but a master mind could develop
it with any chance of success. Nor have the poetical
attempts upon the story fared better. It was
reserved for the pencil of Gustave Dor&eacute; to treat it
with the originality it merited, and in a series of
woodcuts to produce at once a poem, a romance,
and a chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre of art.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>BOUT the middle of the twelfth century, a
rumor circulated through Europe that there
reigned in Asia a powerful Christian Emperor, Presbyter
Johannes. In a bloody fight he had broken the
power of the Mussulmans, and was ready to come to
the assistance of the Crusaders. Great was the exultation
in Europe, for of late the news from the East
had been gloomy and depressing, the power of the
infidel had increased, overwhelming masses of men
had been brought into the field against the chivalry
of Christendom, and it was felt that the cross must
yield before the odious crescent.</p>

<p>The news of the success of the Priest-King
opened a door of hope to the desponding Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
world. Pope Alexander III. determined at once
to effect a union with this mysterious personage,
and on the 27th of September, 1177, wrote him a
letter, which he intrusted to his physician, Philip,
to deliver in person.</p>

<p>Philip started on his embassy, but never returned.
The conquests of Tschengis-Khan again attracted
the eyes of Christian Europe to the East. The
Mongol hordes were rushing in upon the west with
devastating ferocity; Russia, Poland, Hungary, and
the eastern provinces of Germany, had succumbed,
or suffered grievously; and the fears of other nations
were roused lest they too should taste the
misery of a Mongolian invasion. It was Gog and
Magog come to slaughter, and the times of Antichrist
were dawning. But the battle of Liegnitz
stayed them in their onward career, and Europe
was saved.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent IV. determined to convert these
wild hordes of barbarians, and subject them to the
cross of Christ; he therefore sent among them a
number of Dominican and Franciscan missioners,
and embassies of peace passed between the Pope,
the King of France, and the Mogul Khan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
The result of these communications with the East
was, that the travellers learned how false were the
prevalent notions of a mighty Christian empire existing
in Central Asia. Vulgar superstition or conviction is
not, however, to be upset by evidence, and the locality
of the monarchy was merely transferred by the
people to Africa, and they fixed upon Abyssinia, with
a show of truth, as the seat of the famous Priest-King.
However, still some doubted. John de Plano Carpini
and Marco Polo, though they acknowledged the existence
of a Christian monarch in Abyssinia, yet stoutly
maintained as well that the Prester John of popular
belief reigned in splendor somewhere in the dim
Orient.</p>

<p>But before proceeding with the history of this
strange fable, it will be well to extract the different
accounts given of the Priest-King and his realm by
early writers; and we shall then be better able to
judge of the influence the myth obtained in Europe.</p>

<p>Otto of Freisingen is the first author to mention
the monarchy of Prester John with whom we are
acquainted. Otto wrote a chronicle up to the date
1156, and he relates that in 1145 the Catholic Bishop
of Cabala visited Europe to lay certain complaints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
before the Pope. He mentioned the fall of Edessa,
and also &ldquo;he stated that a few years ago a certain
King and Priest called John, who lives on the farther
side of Persia and Armenia, in the remote East, and
who, with all his people, were Christians, though
belonging to the Nestorian Church, had overcome
the royal brothers Samiardi, kings of the Medes and
Persians, and had captured Ecbatana, their capital
and residence. The said kings had met with their
Persian, Median, and Assyrian troops, and had fought
for three consecutive days, each side having determined
to die rather than take to flight. Prester John,
for so they are wont to call him, at length routed the
Persians, and after a bloody battle, remained victorious.
After which victory the said John was hastening
to the assistance of the Church at Jerusalem, but
his host, on reaching the Tigris, was hindered from
passing, through a deficiency in boats, and he directed
his march North, since he had heard that the river
was there covered with ice. In that place he had
waited many years, expecting severe cold; but the
winters having proved unpropitious, and the severity
of the climate having carried off many soldiers, he
had been forced to retreat to his own land. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
king belongs to the family of the Magi, mentioned in
the Gospel, and he rules over the very people formerly
governed by the Magi; moreover, his fame and his
wealth are so great, that he uses an emerald sceptre
only.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited by the example of his ancestors, who
came to worship Christ in his cradle, he had proposed
to go to Jerusalem, but had been impeded by
the above-mentioned causes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the story crops up in other quarters;
so that we cannot look upon Otto as the inventor
of the myth. The celebrated Maimonides alludes to
it in a passage quoted by Joshua Lorki, a Jewish
physician to Benedict XIII. Maimonides lived from
1135 to 1204. The passage is as follows: &ldquo;It is evident
both from the letters of Rambam (Maimonides),
whose memory be blessed, and from the narration of
merchants who have visited the ends of the earth,
that at this time the root of our faith is to be found
in the lands of Babel and Teman, where long ago
Jerusalem was an exile; not reckoning those who
live in the land of Paras<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Madai,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of the exiles
of Schomrom, the number of which people is as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
sand: of these some are still under the yoke of Paras,
who is called the Great-Chief Sultan by the Arabs;
others live in a place under the yoke of a strange
people ... governed by a Christian chief, Preste-Cuan
by name. With him they have made a compact,
and he with them; and this is a matter concerning
which there can be no manner of doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Benjamin of Tudela, another Jew, travelled in the
East between the years 1159 and 1173, the last being
the date of his death. He wrote an account of his
travels, and gives in it some information with regard
to a mythical Jew king, who reigned in the utmost
splendor over a realm inhabited by Jews alone, situate
somewhere in the midst of a desert of vast extent.
About this period there appeared a document which
produced intense excitement throughout Europe&mdash;a
letter, yes! a letter from the mysterious personage
himself to Manuel Comnenus, Emperor of Constantinople
(1143-1180). The exact date of this extraordinary
epistle cannot be fixed with any certainty, but
it certainly appeared before 1241, the date of the
conclusion of the chronicle of Albericus Trium Fontium.
This Albericus relates that in the year 1165
&ldquo;Presbyter Joannes, the Indian king, sent his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
wonderful letter to various Christian princes, and especially
to Manuel of Constantinople, and Frederic
the Roman Emperor.&rdquo; Similar letters were sent to
Alexander III., to Louis VII. of France, and to the
King of Portugal, which are alluded to in chronicles
and romances, and which were indeed turned
into rhyme, and sung all over Europe by minstrels
and trouv&egrave;res. The letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, Priest by the Almighty power of God and
the Might of our Lord Jesus Christ, King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords, to his friend Emanuel, Prince
of Constantinople, greeting, wishing him health,
prosperity, and the continuance of Divine favor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Majesty has been informed that you hold
our Excellency in love, and that the report of our
greatness has reached you. Moreover, we have
heard through our treasurer that you have been
pleased to send to us some objects of art and
interest, that our Exaltedness might be gratified
thereby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being human, I receive it in good part, and we
have ordered our treasurer to send you some of our
articles in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we desire to be made certain that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
hold the right faith, and in all things cleave to
Jesus Christ, our Lord, for we have heard that your
court regard you as a god, though we know that
you are mortal, and subject to human infirmities....
Should you desire to learn the greatness
and excellency of our Exaltedness and of the land
subject to our sceptre, then hear and believe:&mdash;I,
Presbyter Johannes, the Lord of Lords, surpass all
under heaven in virtue, in riches, and in power;
seventy-two kings pay us tribute.... In the three
Indies our Magnificence rules, and our land extends
beyond India, where rests the body of the holy
Apostle Thomas; it reaches towards the sunrise
over the wastes, and it trends towards deserted
Babylon near the tower of Babel. Seventy-two
provinces, of which only a few are Christian, serve
us. Each has its own king, but all are tributary
to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our land is the home of elephants, dromedaries,
camels, crocodiles, meta-collinarum, cametennus, tensevetes,
wild asses, white and red lions, white bears,
white merules, crickets, griffins, tigers, lamias, hyenas,
wild horses, wild oxen and wild men, men
with horns, one-eyed, men with eyes before and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
behind, centaurs, fauns, satyrs, pygmies, forty-ell-high
giants, Cyclopses, and similar women; it is
the home, too, of the ph&oelig;nix, and of nearly all
living animals. We have some people subject to
us who feed on the flesh of men and of prematurely
born animals, and who never fear death. When
any of these people die, their friends and relations
eat him ravenously, for they regard it as a main
duty to munch human flesh. Their names are Gog
and Magog, Anie, Agit, Azenach, Fommeperi,
Befari, Conei-Samante, Agrimandri, Vintefolei, Casbei,
Alanei. These and similar nations were shut
in behind lofty mountains by Alexander the Great,
towards the North. We lead them at our pleasure
against our foes, and neither man nor beast is left
undevoured, if our Majesty gives the requisite permission.
And when all our foes are eaten, then we
return with our hosts home again. These accursed
fifteen nations will burst forth from the four quarters
of the earth at the end of the world, in the times
of Antichrist, and overrun all the abodes of the
Saints as well as the great city Rome, which, by
the way, we are prepared to give to our son who
will be born, along with all Italy, Germany, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
two Gauls, Britain and Scotland. We shall also
give him Spain and all the land as far as the icy
sea. The nations to which I have alluded, according
to the words of the prophet, shall not stand in
the judgment, on account of their offensive practices,
but will be consumed to ashes by a fire which will
fall on them from heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our land streams with honey, and is overflowing
with milk. In one region grows no poisonous
herb, nor does a querulous frog ever quack in it;
no scorpion exists, nor does the serpent glide
amongst the grass, nor can any poisonous animals
exist in it, or injure any one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the heathen, flows through a certain
province the River Indus; encircling Paradise, it
spreads its arms in manifold windings through the
entire province. Here are found the emeralds,
sapphires, carbuncles, topazes, chrysolites, onyxes,
beryls, sardius, and other costly stones. Here grows
the plant Assidos, which, when worn by any one,
protects him from the evil spirit, forcing it to state
its business and name; consequently the foul spirits
keep out of the way there. In a certain land subject
to us, all kinds of pepper is gathered, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
exchanged for corn and bread, leather and cloth....
At the foot of Mount Olympus bubbles up a
spring which changes its flavor hour by hour, night
and day, and the spring is scarcely three days&rsquo;
journey from Paradise, out of which Adam was
driven. If any one has tasted thrice of the fountain,
from that day he will feel no fatigue, but will,
as long as he lives, be as a man of thirty years.
Here are found the small stones called Nudiosi,
which, if borne about the body, prevent the sight
from waxing feeble, and restore it where it is lost.
The more the stone is looked at, the keener becomes
the sight. In our territory is a certain waterless
sea, consisting of tumbling billows of sand
never at rest. None have crossed this sea; it lacks
water altogether, yet fish are cast up upon the
beach of various kinds, very tasty, and the like are
nowhere else to be seen. Three days&rsquo; journey from
this sea are mountains from which rolls down a
stony, waterless river, which opens into the sandy
sea. As soon as the stream reaches the sea, its
stones vanish in it, and are never seen again. As
long as the river is in motion, it cannot be crossed;
only four days a week is it possible to traverse it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
Between the sandy sea and the said mountains, in
a certain plain is a fountain of singular virtue,
which purges Christians and would-be Christians
from all transgressions. The water stands four
inches high in a hollow stone shaped like a mussel-shell.
Two saintly old men watch by it, and ask
the comers whether they are Christians, or are
about to become Christians, then whether they desire
healing with all their hearts. If they have
answered well, they are bidden to lay aside their
clothes, and to step into the mussel. If what they
said be true, then the water begins to rise and gush
over their heads; thrice does the water thus lift
itself, and every one who has entered the mussel
leaves it cured of every complaint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near the wilderness trickles between barren
mountains a subterranean rill, which can only by
chance be reached, for only occasionally the earth
gapes, and he who would descend must do it with
precipitation, ere the earth closes again. All that
is gathered under the ground there is gem and
precious stone. The brook pours into another
river, and the inhabitants of the neighborhood obtain
thence abundance of precious stones. Yet they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
never venture to sell them without having first
offered them to us for our private use: should we
decline them, they are at liberty to dispose of them
to strangers. Boys there are trained to remain
three or four days under water, diving after the
stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond the stone river are the ten tribes of the
Jews, which, though subject to their own kings,
are, for all that, our slaves and tributary to our
Majesty. In one of our lands, hight Zone, are
worms called in our tongue Salamanders. These
worms can only live in fire, and they build cocoons
like silk-worms, which are unwound by the ladies
of our palace, and spun into cloth and dresses,
which are worn by our Exaltedness. These dresses,
in order to be cleaned and washed, are cast into
flames.... When we go to war, we have fourteen
golden and bejewelled crosses borne before us instead
of banners; each of these crosses is followed
by 10,000 horsemen, and 100,000 foot soldiers fully
armed, without reckoning those in charge of the
luggage and provision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we ride abroad plainly, we have a
wooden, unadorned cross, without gold or gem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
about it, borne before us, in order that we may
meditate on the sufferings of Our Lord Jesus
Christ; also a golden bowl filled with earth, to
remind us of that whence we sprung, and that to
which we must return; but besides these there is
borne a silver bowl full of gold, as a token to all
that we are the Lord of Lords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All riches, such as are upon the world, our
Magnificence possesses in superabundance. With
us no one lies, for he who speaks a lie is thenceforth
regarded as dead; he is no more thought of,
or honored by us. No vice is tolerated by us.
Every year we undertake a pilgrimage, with retinue
of war, to the body of the holy prophet Daniel,
which is near the desolated site of Babylon.
In our realm fishes are caught, the blood of which
dyes purple. The Amazons and the Brahmins are
subject to us. The palace in which our Supereminency
resides, is built after the pattern of the
castle built by the Apostle Thomas for the Indian
king Gundoforus. Ceilings, joists, and architrave
are of Sethym wood, the roof of ebony, which
can never catch fire. Over the gable of the palace
are, at the extremities, two golden apples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
in each of which are two carbuncles, so that the
gold may shine by day, and the carbuncles by
night. The greater gates of the palace are of sardius,
with the horn of the horned snake inwrought,
so that no one can bring poison within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other portals are of ebony. The windows
are of crystal; the tables are partly of gold, partly
of amethyst, and the columns supporting the tables
are partly of ivory, partly of amethyst. The court
in which we watch the jousting is floored with
onyx in order to increase the courage of the combatants.
In the palace, at night, nothing is burned
for light but wicks supplied with balsam.... Before
our palace stands a mirror, the ascent to
which consists of five and twenty steps of porphyry
and serpentine.&rdquo; After a description of the
gems adorning this mirror, which is guarded night
and day by three thousand armed men, he explains
its use: &ldquo;We look therein and behold all that is
taking place in every province and region subject
to our sceptre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven kings wait upon us monthly, in turn,
with sixty-two dukes, two hundred and fifty-six
counts and marquises: and twelve archbishops sit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
at table with us on our right, and twenty bishops
on the left, besides the patriarch of St. Thomas, the
Sarmatian Protopope, and the Archpope of Susa....
Our lord high steward is a primate and king,
our cup-bearer is an archbishop and king, our
chamberlain a bishop and king, our marshal a king
and abbot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may be spared further extracts from this extraordinary
letter, which proceeds to describe the
church in which Prester John worships, by enumerating
the precious stones of which it is constructed,
and their special virtues.</p>

<p>Whether this letter was in circulation before
Pope Alexander wrote his, it is not easy to decide.
Alexander does not allude to it, but speaks of the
reports which have reached him of the piety and
the magnificence of the Priest-King. At the same
time, there runs a tone of bitterness through the
letter, as though the Pope had been galled at the
pretensions of this mysterious personage, and perhaps
winced under the prospect of the man-eaters
overrunning Italy, as suggested by John the Priest.
The papal epistle is an assertion of the claims of
the See of Rome to universal dominion, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
assures the Eastern Prince-Pope that his Christian
professions are worthless, unless he submits to the
successor of Peter. &ldquo;Not every one that saith unto
me, Lord, Lord,&rdquo; &amp;c., quotes the Pope, and then
explains that the will of God is that every monarch
and prelate should eat humble pie to the Sovereign
Pontiff.</p>

<p>Sir John Maundevil gives the origin of the
priestly title of the Eastern despot, in his curious
book of travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it befelle, that this emperour cam, with a
Cristene knyght with him, into a chirche in Egypt:
and it was Saterday in Wyttson woke. And the
bishop made orders. And he beheld and listened
the servyse fulle tentyfly: and he asked the Cristene
knyght, what men of degree thei scholden
ben, that the prelate had before him. And the
knyght answerede and seyde, that thei scholde ben
prestes. And then the emperour seyde, that he
wolde no longer ben clept kyng ne emperour, but
preest: and that he wolde have the name of the
first preest, that wente out of the chirche; and his
name was John. And so evere more sittiens, he is
clept Prestre John.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
It is probable that the foundation of the whole
Prester-John myth lay in the report which reached
Europe of the wonderful successes of Nestorianism
in the East, and there seems reason to believe that
the famous letter given above was a Nestorian
fabrication. It certainly looks un-European; the
gorgeous imagery is thoroughly Eastern, and the
disparaging tone in which Rome is spoken of could
hardly have been the expression of Western feelings.
The letter has the object in view of exalting
the East in religion and arts to an undue eminence
at the expense of the West, and it manifests some
ignorance of European geography, when it speaks
of the land extending from Spain to the Polar Sea.
Moreover, the sites of the patriarchates, and the
dignity conferred on that of St. Thomas, are indications
of a Nestorian bias.</p>

<p>A brief glance at the history of this heretical
Church may be of value here, as showing that
there really was a foundation for the wild legends
concerning a Christian empire in the East, so
prevalent in Europe. Nestorius, a priest of Antioch
and a disciple of St. Chrysostom, was elevated
by the emperor to the patriarchate of Constantinople,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
and in the year 428 began to propagate his
heresy, denying the hypostatic union. The Council
of Ephesus denounced him, and, in spite of the
emperor and court, Nestorius was anathematized
and driven into exile. His sect spread through the
East, and became a flourishing church. It reached
to China, where the emperor was all but converted;
its missionaries traversed the frozen tundras of Siberia,
preaching their maimed Gospel to the wild
hordes which haunted those dreary wastes; it faced
Buddhism, and wrestled with it for the religious
supremacy in Thibet; it established churches in
Persia and in Bokhara; it penetrated India; it
formed colonies in Ceylon, in Siam, and in Sumatra;
so that the Catholicos or Pope of Bagdad
exercised sway more extensive than that ever obtained
by the successor of St. Peter. The number
of Christians belonging to that communion probably
exceeded that of the members of the true Catholic
Church in East and West. But the Nestorian
Church was not founded on the Rock; it rested on
Nestorius; and when the rain descended, and the
winds blew, and the floods came, and beat upon
that house, it fell, leaving scarce a fragment behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
Rubruquis the Franciscan, who in 1253 was sent
on a mission into Tartary, was the first to let in a
little light on the fable. He writes, &ldquo;The Catai
dwelt beyond certain mountains across which I wandered,
and in a plain in the midst of the mountains
lived once an important Nestorian shepherd, who
ruled over the Nestorian people, called Nayman.
When Coir-Khan died, the Nestorian people raised
this man to be king, and called him King Johannes,
and related of him ten times as much as the truth.
The Nestorians thereabouts have this way with them,
that about nothing they make a great fuss, and thus
they have got it noised abroad that Sartach, Mangu-Khan,
and Ken-Khan were Christians, simply because
they treated Christians well, and showed them more
honor than other people. Yet, in fact, they were not
Christians at all. And in like manner the story got
about that there was a great King John. However,
I traversed his pastures, and no one knew anything
about him, except a few Nestorians. In his pastures
lives Ken-Khan, at whose court was Brother Andrew,
whom I met on my way back. This Johannes had
a brother, a famous shepherd, named Unc, who lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
three weeks&rsquo; journey beyond the mountains of Caracatais.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Unk-Khan was a real individual; he lost his
life in the year 1203. Kuschhik, prince of the Nayman,
and follower of Kor-Khan, fell in 1218.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller (1254-1324),
identifies Unk-Khan with Prester John; he says, &ldquo;I
will now tell you of the deeds of the Tartars, how
they gained the mastery, and spread over the whole
earth. The Tartars dwelt between Georgia and Bargu,
where there is a vast plain and level country, on
which are neither cities nor forts, but capital pasturage
and water. They had no chief of their own, but
paid to Prester Johannes tribute. Of the greatness
of this Prester Johannes, who was properly called
Un-Khan, the whole world spake; the Tartars gave
him one of every ten head of cattle. When Prester
John noticed that they were increasing, he feared
them, and planned how he could injure them. He
determined therefore to scatter them, and he sent
barons to do this. But the Tartars guessed what
Prester John purposed ... and they went away into
the wide wastes of the North, where they might be
beyond his reach.&rdquo; He then goes on to relate how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
Tschengis-(Jenghiz-)Khan became the head of the
Tartars, and how he fought against Prester John,
and, after a desperate fight, overcame and slew him.</p>

<p>The Syriac Chronicle of the Jacobite Primate,
Gregory Bar-Hebr&aelig;us (born 1226, died 1286), also
identifies Unk-Khan with Prester John. &ldquo;In the
year of the Greeks 1514, of the Arabs 599 (A.&nbsp;D.
1202), when Unk-Khan, who is the Christian King
John, ruled over a stock of the barbarian Hunns,
called Kergt, Tschingys-Khan served him with great
zeal. When John observed the superiority and serviceableness
of the other, he envied him, and plotted
to seize and murder him. But two sons of Unk-Khan,
having heard this, told it to Tschingys; whereupon
he and his comrades fled by night, and secreted
themselves. Next morning Unk-Khan took possession
of the Tartar tents, but found them empty.
Then the party of Tschingys fell upon him, and they
met by the spring called Balschunah, and the side
of Tschingys won the day; and the followers of
Unk-Khan were compelled to yield. They met again
several times, till Unk-Khan was utterly discomfited,
and was slain himself, and his wives, sons, and
daughters carried into captivity. Yet we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
consider that King John the Kergtajer was not cast down
for nought; nay, rather, because he had turned his
heart from the fear of Christ his Lord, who had
exalted him, and had taken a wife of the Zinish
nation, called Quarakhata. Because he forsook the
religion of his ancestors and followed strange gods,
therefore God took the government from him, and
gave it to one better than he, and whose heart was
right before God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the early travellers, such as John de
Plano Carpini and Marco Polo, in disabusing the
popular mind of the belief in Prester John as a
mighty Asiatic Christian monarch, unintentionally
turned the popular faith in that individual into a
new direction. They spoke of the black people of
Abascia in Ethiopia, which, by the way, they called
Middle India, as a great people subject to a Christian
monarch.</p>

<p>Marco Polo says that the true monarch of Abyssinia
is Christ; but that it is governed by six kings, three
of whom are Christians and three Saracens, and that
they are in league with the Soudan of Aden.</p>

<p>Bishop Jordanus, in his description of the world,
accordingly sets down Abyssinia as the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
Prester John; and such was the popular impression,
which was confirmed by the appearance at intervals
of ambassadors at European courts from the King
of Abyssinia. The discovery of the Cape of Good
Hope was due partly to a desire manifested in Portugal
to open communications with this monarch,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
King John II. sent two men learned in Oriental languages
through Egypt to the court of Abyssinia. The
might and dominion of this prince, who had replaced
the Tartar chief in the popular creed as Prester John,
was of course greatly exaggerated, and was supposed
to extend across Arabia and Asia to the wall of
China. The spread of geographical knowledge has
contracted the area of his dominions, and a critical
acquaintance with history has exploded the myth
which invested Unk-Khan, the nomad chief, with all
the attributes of a demigod, uniting in one the utmost
pretensions of a Pope and the proudest claims of a
monarch.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>The Divining Rod.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM the remotest period a rod has been regarded
as the symbol of power and authority,
and Holy Scripture employs it in the popular sense.
Thus David speaks of &ldquo;Thy rod and Thy staff comforting
me;&rdquo; and Moses works his miracles before
Pharaoh with the rod as emblem of Divine commission.
It was his rod which became a serpent, which
turned the water of Egypt into blood, which opened
the waves of the Red Sea and restored them to their
former level, which &ldquo;smote the rock of stone so that
the water gushed out abundantly.&rdquo; The rod of Aaron
acted an oracular part in the contest with the princes;
laid up before the ark, it budded and brought forth
almonds. In this instance we have it no longer as
a symbol of authority, but as a means of divining
the will of God. And as such it became liable
to abuse; thus Hosea rebukes the chosen people
for practising similar divinations. &ldquo;My people ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto
them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Long before this, Jacob had made a different use
of rods, employing them as a charm to make his
father-in-law&rsquo;s sheep bear pied and spotted lambs.</p>

<p>We find rhabdomancy a popular form of divination
among the Greeks, and also among the Romans.
Cicero in his &ldquo;De Officiis&rdquo; alludes to it. &ldquo;If all
that is needful for our nourishment and support arrives
to us by means of some divine rod, as people
say, then each of us, free from all care and trouble,
may give himself up to the exclusive pursuit of
study and science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Probably it is to this rod that the allusion of
Ennius, as the agent in discovering hidden treasures,
quoted in the first book of his &ldquo;De Divinatione,&rdquo;
refers.</p>

<p>According to Vetranius Maurus, Varro left a satire
on the &ldquo;Virgula divina,&rdquo; which has not been preserved.
Tacitus tells us that the Germans practised
some sort of divination by means of rods. &ldquo;For
the purpose their method is simple. They cut a
rod off some fruit-tree into bits, and after having
distinguished them by various marks, they cast them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
into a white cloth.... Then the priest thrice
draws each piece, and explains the oracle according
to the marks.&rdquo; Ammianus Marcellinus says that
the Alains employed an osier rod.</p>

<p>The fourteenth law of the Frisons ordered that
the discovery of murders should be made by means
of divining rods used in Church. These rods should
be laid before the altar, and on the sacred relics,
after which God was to be supplicated to indicate
the culprit. This was called the Lot of Rods, or
Tan-teen, the Rod of Rods.</p>

<p>But the middle ages was the date of the full
development of the superstition, and the divining rod
was believed to have efficacy in discovering hidden
treasures, veins of precious metal, springs of water,
thefts, and murders. The first notice of its general
use among late writers is in the &ldquo;Testamentum
Novum,&rdquo; lib. i. cap. 25, of Basil Valentine, a Benedictine
monk of the fifteenth century. Basil speaks
of the general faith in and adoption of this valuable
instrument for the discovery of metals, which is
carried by workmen in mines, either in their belts
or in their caps. He says that there are seven
names by which this rod is known, and to its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
excellences under each title he devotes a chapter of
his book. The names are: Divine Rod, Shining
Rod, Leaping Rod, Transcendent Rod, Trembling
Rod, Dipping Rod, Superior Rod. In his admirable
treatise on metals, Agricola speaks of the rod
in terms of disparagement; he considers its use as
a relic of ancient magical forms, and he says that
it is only irreligious workmen who employ it in
their search after metals. Goclenius, however, in
his treatise on the virtue of plants, stoutly does battle
for the properties of the hazel rod. Whereupon
Roberti, a Flemish Jesuit, falls upon him tooth and
nail, disputes his facts, overwhelms him with abuse,
and gibbets him for popular ridicule. Andreas Libavius,
a writer I have already quoted in my article
on the Wandering Jew, undertook a series of experiments
upon the hazel divining rod, and concluded
that there was truth in the popular belief.
The Jesuit Kircher also &ldquo;experimentalized several
times on wooden rods which were declared to be
sympathetic with regard to certain metals, by placing
them on delicate pivots in equilibrium; but they
never turned on the approach of metal.&rdquo; (De Arte
Magnetica.) However, a similar course of experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
over water led him to attribute to the rod the
power of indicating subterranean springs and water-courses;
&ldquo;I would not affirm it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;unless I
had established the fact by my own experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dechales, another Jesuit, author of a treatise on
natural springs, and of a huge tome entitled &ldquo;Mundus
Mathematicus,&rdquo; declared in the latter work,
that no means of discovering sources is equal to
the divining rod; and he quotes a friend of his
who, with a hazel rod in his hand, could discover
springs with the utmost precision and facility, and
could trace on the surface of the ground the course
of a subterranean conduit. Another writer, Saint-Romain,
in his &ldquo;Science d&eacute;gag&eacute;e des Chim&egrave;res de
l&rsquo;&Eacute;cole,&rdquo; exclaims, &ldquo;Is it not astonishing to see a rod,
which is held firmly in the hands, bow itself and
turn visibly in the direction of water or metal, with
more or less promptitude, according as the metal or
the water are near or remote from the surface!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1659 the Jesuit Gaspard Schott writes that the
rod is used in every town of Germany, and that he
had frequent opportunity of seeing it used in the
discovery of hidden treasures. &ldquo;I searched with the
greatest care,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;into the question whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
the hazel rod had any sympathy with gold and silver,
and whether any natural property set it in motion.
In like manner I tried whether a ring of
metal, held suspended by a thread in the midst of
a tumbler, and which strikes the hours, is moved
by any similar force. I ascertained that these effects
could only have rise from the deception of those
holding the rod or the pendulum, or, may be, from
some diabolic impulsion, or, more likely still, because
imagination sets the hand in motion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sieur le Royer, a lawyer of Rouen, in 1674,
published his &ldquo;Trait&eacute; du B&acirc;ton universel,&rdquo; in which
he gives an account of a trial made with the rod
in the presence of Father Jean Fran&ccedil;ois, who had
ridiculed the operation in his treatise on the science
of waters, published at Rennes in 1655, and which
succeeded in convincing the blasphemer of the divine
Rod. Le Royer denies to it the power of picking
out criminals, which had been popularly attributed
to it, and as had been unhesitatingly claimed for it
by Debrio in his &ldquo;Disquisitio Magica.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now I am brought to the extraordinary story
of Jacques Aymar, which attracted the attention of
Europe to the marvellous properties of the divining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
rod. I shall give the history of this man in full, as
such an account is rendered necessary by the mutilated
versions I have seen current in English magazine
articles, which follow the lead of Mrs. Crowe,
who narrates the earlier portion of this impostor&rsquo;s
career, but says nothing of his <i>expos&eacute;</i> and downfall.</p>

<p>On the 5th July, 1692, at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, a wine-seller of Lyons and his wife were
assassinated in their cellar, and their money carried
off. On the morrow, the officers of justice arrived,
and examined the premises. Beside the corpses, lay
a large bottle wrapped in straw, and a bloody hedging
bill, which undoubtedly had been the instrument
used to accomplish the murder. Not a trace of
those who had committed the horrible deed was to
be found, and the magistrates were quite at fault
as to the direction in which they should turn for a
clew to the murderer or murderers.</p>

<p>At this juncture a neighbor reminded the magistrates
of an incident which had taken place four
years previous. It was this. In 1688 a theft of
clothes had been made in Grenoble. In the parish
of Cr&ocirc;le lived a man named Jacques Aymar, supposed
to be endowed with the faculty of using the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
divining rod. This man was sent for. On reaching
the spot where the theft had been committed, his
rod moved in his hand. He followed the track indicated
by the rod, and it continued to rotate between
his fingers as long as he followed a certain direction,
but ceased to turn if he diverged from it in the smallest
degree. Guided by his rod, Aymar went from
street to street, till he was brought to a standstill
before the prison gates. These could not be opened
without leave of the magistrate, who hastened to witness
the experiment. The gates were unlocked, and
Aymar, under the same guidance, directed his steps
towards four prisoners lately incarcerated. He ordered
the four to be stood in a line, and then he
placed his foot on that of the first. The rod remained
immovable. He passed to the second, and
the rod turned at once. Before the third prisoner
there were no signs; the fourth trembled, and begged
to be heard. He owned himself the thief, along
with the second, who also acknowledged the theft,
and mentioned the name of the receiver of the stolen
goods. This was a farmer in the neighborhood of
Grenoble. The magistrate and officers visited him
and demanded the articles he had obtained. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
farmer denied all knowledge of the theft and all participation
in the booty. Aymar, however, by means
of his rod, discovered the secreted property, and restored
it to the persons from whom it had been stolen.</p>

<p>On another occasion Aymar had been in quest of a
spring of water, when he felt his rod turn sharply in
his hand. On digging at the spot, expecting to discover
an abundant source, the body of a murdered
woman was found in a barrel, with a rope twisted
round her neck. The poor creature was recognized
as a woman of the neighborhood who had vanished
four months before. Aymar went to the house which
the victim had inhabited, and presented his rod to
each member of the household. It turned upon the
husband of the deceased, who at once took to flight.</p>

<p>The magistrates of Lyons, at their wits&rsquo; ends how
to discover the perpetrators of the double murder in
the wine shop, urged the Procureur du Roi to make
experiment of the powers of Jacques Aymar. The
fellow was sent for, and he boldly asserted his capacity
for detecting criminals, if he were first brought to
the spot of the murder, so as to be put <i>en rapport</i>
with the murderers.</p>

<p>He was at once conducted to the scene of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
outrage, with the rod in his hand. This remained stationary
as he traversed the cellar, till he reached the
spot where the body of the wine seller had lain; then
the stick became violently agitated, and the man&rsquo;s
pulse rose as though he were in an access of fever.
The same motions and symptoms manifested themselves
when he reached the place where the second
victim had lain.</p>

<p>Having thus received his <em>impression</em>, Aymar left
the cellar, and, guided by his rod, or rather by an
internal instinct, he ascended into the shop, and then
stepping into the street, he followed from one to
another, like a hound upon the scent, the track of the
murderers. It conducted him into the court of the
archiepiscopal palace, across it, and down to the gate
of the Rhone. It was now evening, and the city
gates being all closed, the quest of blood was relinquished
for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning Aymar returned to the scent. Accompanied
by three officers, he left the gate, and
descended the right bank of the Rhone. The rod
gave indications of there having been three involved
in the murder, and he pursued the traces till two of
them led to a gardener&rsquo;s cottage. Into this he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
entered, and there he asserted with warmth, against the
asseverations of the proprietor to the contrary, that
the fugitives had entered his room, had seated themselves
at his table, and had drunk wine out of one of
the bottles which he indicated. Aymar tested each
of the household with his rod, to see if they had been
in contact with the murderers. The rod moved over
the two children only, aged respectively ten and nine
years. These little things, on being questioned, answered,
with reluctance, that during their father&rsquo;s
absence on Sunday morning, against his express commands,
they had left the door open, and that two
men, whom they described, had come in suddenly
upon them, and had seated themselves and made
free with the wine in the bottle pointed out by the
man with the rod. This first verification of the talents
of Jacques Aymar convinced some of the sceptical, but
the Procurateur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral forbade the prosecution of the
experiment till the man had been further tested.</p>

<p>As already stated, a hedging bill had been discovered,
on the scene of the murder, smeared with
blood, and unquestionably the weapon with which
the crime had been committed. Three bills from the
same maker, and of precisely the same description,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
were obtained, and the four were taken into a garden,
and secretly buried at intervals. Aymar was then
brought, staff in hand, into the garden, and conducted
over the spots where lay the bills. The rod began to
vibrate as his feet stood upon the place where was
concealed the bill which had been used by the assassins,
but was motionless elsewhere. Still unsatisfied,
the four bills were exhumed and concealed anew.
The comptroller of the province himself bandaged
the sorcerer&rsquo;s eyes, and led him by the hand from
place to place. The divining rod showed no signs
of movement till it approached the blood-stained
weapon, when it began to oscillate.</p>

<p>The magistrates were now so far satisfied as to
agree that Jacques Aymar should be authorized to
follow the trail of the murderers, and have a company
of archers to follow him.</p>

<p>Guided by his rod, Aymar now recommenced his
pursuit. He continued tracing down the right bank
of the Rhone till he came to half a league from the
bridge of Lyons. Here the footprints of three men
were observed in the sand, as though engaged in
entering a boat. A rowing boat was obtained, and
Aymar, with his escort, descended the river; he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
some difficulty in following the trail upon water;
still he was able, with a little care, to detect it. It
brought him under an arch of the bridge of Vienne,
which boats rarely passed beneath. This proved that
the fugitives were without a guide. The way in
which this curious journey was made was singular.
At intervals Aymar was put ashore to test the banks
with his rod, and ascertain whether the murderers
had landed. He discovered the places where they
had slept, and indicated the chairs or benches on
which they had sat. In this manner, by slow degrees,
he arrived at the military camp of Sablon, between
Vienne and Saint-Valier. There Aymar felt violent
agitation, his cheeks flushed, and his pulse beat with
rapidity. He penetrated the crowds of soldiers, but
did not venture to use his rod, lest the men should
take it ill, and fall upon him. He could not do more
without special authority, and was constrained to return
to Lyons. The magistrates then provided him
with the requisite powers, and he went back to the
camp. Now he declared that the murderers were not
there. He recommenced his pursuit, and descended
the Rhone again as far as Beaucaire.</p>

<p>On entering the town he ascertained by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
his rod that those whom he was pursuing had parted
company. He traversed several streets, then crowded
on account of the annual fair, and was brought to a
standstill before the prison doors. One of the murderers
was within, he declared; he would track the
others afterwards. Having obtained permission to
enter, he was brought into the presence of fourteen
or fifteen prisoners. Amongst these was a hunchback,
who had only an hour previously been incarcerated
on account of a theft he had committed at the
fair. Aymar applied his rod to each of the prisoners
in succession: it turned upon the hunchback. The
sorcerer ascertained that the other two had left the
town by a little path leading into the Nismes road.
Instead of following this track, he returned to Lyons
with the hunchback and the guard. At Lyons a
triumph awaited him. The hunchback had hitherto
protested his innocence, and declared that he had
never set foot in Lyons. But as he was brought to
that town by the way along which Aymar had ascertained
that he had left it, the fellow was recognized
at the different houses where he had lodged the night,
or stopped for food. At the little town of Bagnols, he
was confronted with the host and hostess of a tavern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
where he and his comrades had slept, and they swore
to his identity, and accurately described his companions:
their description tallied with that given by the
children of the gardener. The wretched man was so
confounded by this recognition, that he avowed having
staid there, a few days before, along with two
Proven&ccedil;als. These men, he said, were the criminals;
he had been their servant, and had only kept guard
in the upper room whilst they committed the murders
in the cellar.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Lyons he was committed to
prison, and his trial was decided on. At his first
interrogation he told his tale precisely as he had
related it before, with these additions: the murderers
spoke patois, and had purchased two bills. At ten
o&rsquo;clock in the evening all three had entered the wine
shop. The Proven&ccedil;als had a large bottle wrapped in
straw, and they persuaded the publican and his wife
to descend with them into the cellar to fill it, whilst
he, the hunchback, acted as watch in the shop. The
two men murdered the wine-seller and his wife with
their bills, and then mounted to the shop, where they
opened the coffer, and stole from it one hundred and
thirty crowns, eight louis-d&rsquo;ors, and a silver belt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
The crime accomplished, they took refuge in the
court of a large house,&mdash;this was the archbishop&rsquo;s
palace, indicated by Aymar,&mdash;and passed the night
in it. Next day, early, they left Lyons, and only
stopped for a moment at a gardener&rsquo;s cottage.
Some way down the river, they found a boat
moored to the bank. This they loosed from its
mooring and entered. They came ashore at the
spot pointed out by the man with the stick. They
staid some days in the camp at Sablon, and then
went on to Beaucaire.</p>

<p>Aymar was now sent in quest of the other murderers.
He resumed their trail at the gate of
Beaucaire, and that of one of them, after considerable
<i>d&eacute;tours</i>, led him to the prison doors of
Beaucaire, and he asked to be allowed to search
among the prisoners for his man. This time he
was mistaken. The second fugitive was not within;
but the jailer affirmed that a man whom he
described&mdash;and his description tallied with the
known appearance of one of the Proven&ccedil;als&mdash;had
called at the gate shortly after the removal of the
hunchback to inquire after him, and on learning
of his removal to Lyons, had hurried off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
precipitately. Aymar now followed his track from
the prison, and this brought him to that of the
third criminal. He pursued the double scent for
some days. But it became evident that the two
culprits had been alarmed at what had transpired in
Beaucaire, and were flying from France. Aymar
traced them to the frontier, and then returned to
Lyons.</p>

<p>On the 30th of August, 1692, the poor hunchback
was, according to sentence, broken on the
wheel, in the Place des Terreaux. On his way to
execution he had to pass the wine shop. There
the recorder publicly read his sentence, which had
been delivered by thirty judges. The criminal
knelt and asked pardon of the poor wretches in
whose murder he was involved, after which he
continued his course to the place fixed for his
execution.</p>

<p>It may be well here to give an account of the
authorities for this extraordinary story. There are
three circumstantial accounts, and numerous letters
written by the magistrate who sat during the trial,
and by an eye-witness of the whole transaction,
men honorable and disinterested, upon whose veracity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
not a shadow of doubt was supposed to rest
by their contemporaries.</p>

<p>M. Chauvin, Doctor of Medicine, published a
&ldquo;<i>Lettre &agrave; Mme. la Marquise de Senozan, sur
les moyens dont on s&rsquo;est servi pour d&eacute;couvrir les
complices d&rsquo;un assassinat commis &agrave; Lyon, le 5
Juillet, 1692</i>.&rdquo; Lyons, 1692. The <i>proc&egrave;s-verbal</i>
of the Procureur du Roi, M. de Vanini, is also
extant, and published in the <i>Physique occulte</i> of
the Abb&eacute; de Vallemont.</p>

<p>Pierre Gamier, Doctor of Medicine of the University
of Montpellier, wrote a <i>Dissertation physique
en forme de lettre, &agrave; M. de S&egrave;ve, seigneur
de Fl&eacute;ch&egrave;res</i>, on Jacques Aymar, printed the same
year at Lyons, and republished in the <i>Histoire
critique des pratiques superstitieuses du P&egrave;re
Lebrun</i>.</p>

<p>Doctor Chauvin was witness of nearly all the
circumstances related, as was also the Abb&eacute;
Lagarde, who has written a careful account of the
whole transaction as far as to the execution of
the hunchback.</p>

<p>Another eye-witness writes to the Abb&eacute; Bignon
a letter printed by Lebrun in his <i>Histoire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
critique</i> cited above. &ldquo;The following circumstance
happened to me yesterday evening,&rdquo; he says: &ldquo;M.
le Procureur du Roi here, who, by the way, is one
of the wisest and cleverest men in the country,
sent for me at six o&rsquo;clock, and had me conducted
to the scene of the murder. We found there M.
Grimaut, director of the customs, whom I knew
to be a very upright man, and a young attorney
named Besson, with whom I am not acquainted,
but who M. le Procureur du Roi told me had the
power of using the rod as well as M. Grimaut.
We descended into the cellar where the murder
had been committed, and where there were still
traces of blood. Each time that M. Grimaut and
the attorney passed the spot where the murder had
been perpetrated, the rods they held in their hands
began to turn, but ceased when they stepped beyond
the spot. We tried experiments for more
than an hour, as also with the bill, which M.
le Procureur had brought along with him, and
they were satisfactory. I observed several curious
facts in the attorney. The rod in his hands was
more violently moved than in those of M. Grimaut,
and when I placed one of my fingers in each of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
his hands, whilst the rod turned, I felt the most extraordinary
throbbings of the arteries in his palms.
His pulse was at fever heat. He sweated profusely,
and at intervals he was compelled to go into the
court to obtain fresh air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sieur Pauthot, Dean of the College of
Medicine at Lyons, gave his observations to the
public as well. Some of them are as follows:
&ldquo;We began at the cellar in which the murder had
been committed; into this the man with the rod
(Aymar) shrank from entering, because he felt
violent agitations which overcame him when he
used the stick over the place where the corpses
of those who had been assassinated had lain. On
entering the cellar, the rod was put in my hands,
and arranged by the master as most suitable for
operation; I passed and repassed over the spot
where the bodies had been found, but it remained
immovable, and I felt no agitation. A lady of rank
and merit, who was with us, took the rod after
me; she felt it begin to move, and was internally
agitated. Then the owner of the rod resumed it,
and, passing over the same places, the stick rotated
with such violence that it seemed easier to break
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
than to stop it. The peasant then quitted our
company to faint away, as was his wont after
similar experiments. I followed him. He turned
very pale and broke into a profuse perspiration,
whilst for a quarter of an hour his pulse was violently
troubled; indeed, the faintness was so considerable,
that they were obliged to dash water in
his face and give him water to drink in order to
bring him round.&rdquo; He then describes experiments
made over the bloody bill and others similar, which
succeeded in the hands of Aymar and the lady, but
failed when he attempted them himself. Pierre
Garnier, physician of the medical college of Montpellier,
appointed to that of Lyons, has also written
an account of what he saw, as mentioned above.
He gives a curious proof of Aymar&rsquo;s powers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M. le Lieutenant-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral having been robbed
by one of his lackeys, seven or eight months ago,
and having lost by him twenty-five crowns which
had been taken out of one of the cabinets behind
his library, sent for Aymar, and asked him to
discover the circumstances. Aymar went several
times round the chamber, rod in hand, placing
one foot on the chairs, on the various articles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
furniture, and on two bureaux which are in the
apartment, each of which contains several drawers.
He fixed on the very bureau and the identical
drawer out of which the money had been stolen.
M. le Lieutenant-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral bade him follow the
track of the robber. He did so. With his rod
he went out on a new terrace, upon which the
cabinet opens, thence back into the cabinet and
up to the fire, then into the library, and from
thence he went direct up stairs to the lackeys&rsquo;
sleeping apartment, when the rod guided him to
one of the beds, and turned over one side of the
bed, remaining motionless over the other. The
lackeys then present cried out that the thief had
slept on the side indicated by the rod, the bed
having been shared with another footman, who
occupied the further side.&rdquo; Garnier gives a lengthy
account of various experiments he made along with
the Lieutenant-G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, the uncle of the same, the
Abb&eacute; de St. Remain, and M. de Puget, to detect
whether there was imposture in the man. But all
their attempts failed to discover a trace of deception.
He gives a report of a verbal examination
of Aymar which is interesting. The man always
replied with candor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
The report of the extraordinary discovery of
murder made by the divining rod at Lyons attracted
the attention of Paris, and Aymar was
ordered up to the capital. There, however, his
powers left him. The Prince de Cond&eacute; submitted
him to various tests, and he broke down under
every one. Five holes were dug in the garden.
In one was secreted gold, in another silver, in
a third silver and gold, in the fourth copper, and
in the fifth stones. The rod made no signs in
presence of the metals, and at last actually began
to move over the buried pebbles. He was sent to
Chantilly to discover the perpetrators of a theft of
trout made in the ponds of the park. He went
round the water, rod in hand, and it turned at spots
where he said the fish had been drawn out. Then,
following the track of the thief, it led him to the
cottage of one of the keepers, but did not move
over any of the individuals then in the house. The
keeper himself was absent, but arrived late at
night, and, on hearing what was said, he roused
Aymar from his bed, insisting on having his innocence
vindicated. The divining rod, however, pronounced
him guilty, and the poor fellow took to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
heels, much upon the principle recommended by
Montesquieu a while after. Said he, &ldquo;If you are
accused of having stolen the towers of Notre-Dame,
bolt at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A peasant, taken at haphazard from the street,
was brought to the sorcerer as one suspected. The
rod turned slightly, and Aymar declared that the
man did not steal the fish, but ate of them. A
boy was then introduced, who was said to be the
keeper&rsquo;s son. The rod rotated violently at once.
This was the finishing stroke, and Aymar was
sent away by the Prince in disgrace. It now
transpired that the theft of fish had taken place
seven years before, and the lad was no relation of
the keeper, but a country boy who had only been
in Chantilly eight or ten months. M. Goyonnot,
Recorder of the King&rsquo;s Council, broke a window
in his house, and sent for the diviner, to whom he
related a story of his having been robbed of valuables
during the night. Aymar indicated the
broken window as the means whereby the thief had
entered the house, and pointed out the window by
which he had left it with the booty. As no such
robbery had been committed, Aymar was turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
out of the house as an impostor. A few similar
cases brought him into such disrepute that he was
obliged to leave Paris, and return to Grenoble.</p>

<p>Some years after, he was made use of by the
Mar&eacute;chal Montrevel, in his cruel pursuit of the
Camisards.</p>

<p>Was Aymar an impostor from first to last, or
did his powers fail him in Paris? and was it only
then that he had recourse to fraud?</p>

<p>Much may be said in favor of either supposition.
His <i>expos&eacute;</i> at Paris tells heavily against him, but
need not be regarded as conclusive evidence of imposture
throughout his career. If he really did
possess the powers he claimed, it is not to be supposed
that these existed in full vigor under all conditions;
and Paris is a place most unsuitable for
testing them, built on artificial soil, and full of disturbing
influences of every description. It has been
remarked with others who used the rod, that their
powers languished under excitement, and that the
faculties had to be in repose, the attention to be
concentrated on the subject of inquiry, or the action&mdash;nervous,
magnetic, or electrical, or what you
will&mdash;was impeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Now, Paris, visited for the first time by a poor
peasant, its <i>salons</i> open to him, dazzling him with
their splendor, and the novelty of finding himself in
the midst of princes, dukes, marquises, and their
families, not only may have agitated the countryman
to such an extent as to deprive him of his
peculiar faculty, but may have led him into simulating
what he felt had departed from him, at the
moment when he was under the eyes of the grandees
of the Court. We have analogous cases in
Bleton and Angelique Cottin. The former was a
hydroscope, who fell into convulsions whenever he
passed over running water. This peculiarity was
noticed in him when a child of seven years old.
When brought to Paris, he failed signally to detect
the presence of water conveyed underground by
pipes and conduits, but he pretended to feel the
influence of water where there certainly was none.
Angelique Cottin was a poor girl, highly charged
with electricity. Any one touching her received
a violent shock; one medical gentleman, having
seated her on his knee, was knocked clean out of
his chair by the electric fluid, which thus exhibited
its sense of propriety. But the electric condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
of Angelique became feebler as she approached
Paris, and failed her altogether in the capital.</p>

<p>I believe that the imagination is the principal
motive force in those who use the divining rod;
but whether it is so solely, I am unable to decide.
The powers of nature are so mysterious and inscrutable
that we must be cautious in limiting
them, under abnormal conditions, to the ordinary
laws of experience.</p>

alt="How to hold a divining rod" />
</div>

<p>The manner in which the rod was used by certain
persons renders self-deception possible. The
rod is generally of hazel, and is forked like a Y;
the forefingers are placed against the diverging
arms of the rod, and the elbows are brought back
against the side; thus the implement is held in
front of the operator, delicately balanced before the
pit of the stomach at a distance of about eight
inches. Now, if the pressure of the balls of the
digits be in the least relaxed, the stalk of the rod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
will naturally fall. It has been assumed by some,
that a restoration of the pressure will bring the
stem up again, pointing towards the operator, and
a little further pressure will elevate it into a perpendicular
position. A relaxation of force will
again lower it, and thus the rotation observed in
the rod be maintained. I confess myself unable to
accomplish this. The lowering of the leg of the
rod is easy enough, but no efforts of mine to produce
a revolution on its axis have as yet succeeded.
The muscles which would contract the
fingers upon the arms of the stick, pass the shoulder;
and it is worthy of remark that one of the
medical men who witnessed the experiments made
on Bleton the hydroscope, expressly alludes to a
slight rising of the shoulders during the rotation of
the divining rod.</p>

<p>But the manner of using the rod was by no
means identical in all cases. If, in all cases, it
had simply been balanced between the fingers,
some probability might be given to the suggestion
above made, that the rotation was always
effected by the involuntary action of the muscles.</p>

<p>The usual manner of holding the rod, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
precluded such a possibility. The most ordinary use
consisted in taking a forked stick in such a manner
that the palms were turned upwards, and the fingers
closed upon the branching arms of the rod. Some
required the normal position of the rod to be horizontal,
others elevated the point, others again depressed
it.</p>

<p>If the implement were straight, it was held in a
similar manner, but the hands were brought somewhat
together, so as to produce a slight arc in the
rod. Some who practised rhabdomancy sustained this
species of rod between their thumbs and forefingers;
or else the thumb and forefingers were closed, and the
rod rested on their points; or again it reposed on the
flat of the hand, or on the back, the hand being held
vertically and the rod held in equilibrium.</p>

<p>A third species of divining rod consisted in a
straight staff cut in two: one extremity of the one
half was hollowed out, the other half was sharpened
at the end, and this end was inserted in the hollow,
and the pointed stick rotated in the cavity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">

<p class="caption">POSITIONS OF THE HANDS.<br />
From &ldquo;Lettres qui d&eacute;couvrent l&rsquo;Illusion des Philosophes sur la Baguette.&rdquo;
Paris, 1693.</p>

<p>The way in which Bleton used his rod is thus
minutely described: &ldquo;He does not grasp it, nor
warm it in his hands, and he does not regard with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"><!-- original location of illustration Positions of the hands --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
preference a hazel branch lately cut and full of sap.
He places horizontally between his forefingers a rod
of any kind given to him, or picked up in the road,
of any sort of wood except elder, fresh or dry, not
always forked, but sometimes merely bent. If it is
straight, it rises slightly at the extremities by little
jerks, but does not turn. If bent, it revolves on its
axis with more or less rapidity, in more or less time,
according to the quantity and current of the water.
I counted from thirty to thirty-five revolutions in a
minute, and afterwards as many as eighty. A
curious phenomenon is, that Bleton is able to make
the rod turn between another person&rsquo;s fingers, even
without seeing it or touching it, by approaching his
body towards it when his feet stand over a subterranean
watercourse. It is true, however, that the
motion is much less strong and less durable in other
fingers than his own. If Bleton stood on his head,
and placed the rod between his feet, though he felt
strongly the peculiar sensations produced in him by
flowing water, yet the rod remained stationary. If
he were insulated on glass, silk, or wax, the sensations
were less vivid, and the rotation of the stick
ceased.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
But this experiment failed in Paris, under circumstances
which either proved that Bleton&rsquo;s imagination
produced the movement, or that his integrity
was questionable. It is quite possible that in many
instances the action of the muscles is purely involuntary,
and is attributable to the imagination, so that
the operator deceives himself as well as others.</p>

<p>This is probably the explanation of the story of
Mdlle. Olivet, a young lady of tender conscience, who
was a skilful performer with the divining rod, but
shrank from putting her powers in operation, lest she
should be indulging in unlawful acts. She consulted
the P&egrave;re Lebrun, author of a work already referred to
in this paper, and he advised her to ask God to withdraw
the power from her, if the exercise of it was
harmful to her spiritual condition. She entered into
retreat for two days, and prayed with fervor. Then
she made her communion, asking God what had been
recommended to her at the moment when she received
the Host. In the afternoon of the same
day she made experiment with her rod, and found
that it would no longer operate. The girl had
strong faith in it before&mdash;a faith coupled with fear;
and as long as that faith was strong in her, the rod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
moved; now she believed that the faculty was taken
from her; and the power ceased with the loss of her
faith.</p>

<p>If the divining rod is put in motion by any other
force except the involuntary action of the muscles, we
must confine its powers to the property of indicating
the presence of flowing water. There are numerous
instances of hydroscopes thus detecting the existence
of a spring, or of a subterranean watercourse; the
most remarkably endowed individuals of this description
are Jean-Jacques Parangue, born near Marseilles,
in 1760, who experienced a horror when near water
which no one else perceived. He was endowed with
the faculty of seeing water through the ground, says
l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; Sauri, who gives his history. Jenny Leslie, a
Scotch girl, about the same date claimed similar
powers. In 1790, Pennet, a native of Dauphin&eacute;,
attracted attention in Italy, but when carefully tested
by scientific men in Padua, his attempts to discover
buried metals failed; at Florence he was detected
in an endeavor to find out by night what had been
secreted to test his powers on the morrow. Vincent
Amoretti was an Italian, who underwent peculiar
sensations when brought in proximity to water, coal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
and salt; he was skilful in the use of the rod, but
made no public exhibition of his powers.</p>

<p>The rod is still employed, I have heard it asserted,
by Cornish miners; but I have never been able to
ascertain that such is really the case. The mining
captains whom I have questioned invariably repudiated
all knowledge of its use.</p>

<p>In Wiltshire, however, it is still employed for the
purpose of detecting water; and the following extract
from a letter I have just received will show that
it is still in vogue on the Continent:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the use of the divining rod for discovering
springs of water has by no means been
confined to medi&aelig;val times; for I was personally
acquainted with a lady, now deceased, who has successfully
practised with it in this way. She was a
very clever and accomplished woman; Scotch by birth
and education; by no means credulous; possibly a
a little imaginative, for she wrote not unsuccessfully;
and of a remarkably open and straightforward disposition.
Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, her husband, had a large
estate in Holstein, near Lubeck, supporting a considerable
population; and whether for the wants of the
people or for the improvement of the land, it now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
and then happened that an additional well was
needed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one of these occasions a man was sent for
who made a regular profession of finding water by
the divining rod; there happened to be a large party
staying at the house, and the whole company turned
out to see the fun. The rod gave indications in the
usual way, and water was ultimately found at the
spot. Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;, utterly sceptical, took the rod
into her own hands to make experiment, believing
that she would prove the man an impostor; and she
said afterwards she was never more frightened in her
life than when it began to move, on her walking over
the spring. Several other gentlemen and ladies tried
it, but it was quite inactive in their hands. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said the host to his wife, &lsquo;we shall have no occasion
to send for the man again, as you are such an adept.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some months after this, water was wanted in
another part of the estate, and it occurred to Mrs.
C&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;that she would use the rod again. After some
trials, it again gave decided indications, and a well
was begun and carried down a very considerable
depth. At last she began to shrink from incurring
more expense, but the laborers had implicit faith; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
begged to be allowed to persevere. Very soon the
water burst up with such force that the men escaped
with difficulty; and this proved afterwards the most
unfailing spring for miles round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take the above for what it is worth; the
facts I have given are undoubtedly true, whatever
conclusions may be drawn from them. I do not propose
that you should print my narrative, but I think
in these cases personal testimony, even indirect, is
more useful in forming one&rsquo;s opinion than a hundred
old volumes. I did not hear it from Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s
own lips, but I was sufficiently acquainted with her to
form a very tolerable estimate of her character; and
my wife, who has known her intimately from her
own childhood, was in her younger days often staying
with her for months together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember having been much perplexed by reading
a series of experiments made with a pendulous
ring over metals, by a Mr. Mayo: he ascertained that
it oscillated in various directions under peculiar circumstances,
when suspended by a thread over the ball
of the thumb. I instituted a series of experiments,
and was surprised to find the ring vibrate in an unaccountable
manner in opposite directions over different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
metals. On consideration, I closed my eyes whilst
the ring was oscillating over gold, and on opening
them I found that it had become stationary. I got a
friend to change the metals whilst I was blindfolded&mdash;the
ring no longer vibrated. I was thus enabled
to judge of the involuntary action of muscles, quite
sufficient to have deceived an eminent medical man
like Mr. Mayo, and to have perplexed me till I succeeded
in solving the mystery.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the most picturesque myths of ancient
days is that which forms the subject of this
article. It is thus told by Jacques de Voragine, in
his &ldquo;Legenda Aurea:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The seven sleepers were natives of Ephesus.
The Emperor Decius, who persecuted the Christians,
having come to Ephesus, ordered the erection of
temples in the city, that all might come and sacrifice
before him; and he commanded that the Christians
should be sought out and given their choice, either to
worship the idols, or to die. So great was the consternation
in the city, that the friend denounced his
friend, the father his son, and the son his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there were in Ephesus seven Christians,
Maximian, Malchus, Marcian, Dionysius, John, Serapion,
and Constantine by name. These refused to
sacrifice to the idols, and remained in their houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
praying and fasting. They were accused before
Decius, and they confessed themselves to be Christians.
However, the emperor gave them a little
time to consider what line they would adopt. They
took advantage of this reprieve to dispense their
goods among the poor, and then they retired, all
seven, to Mount Celion, where they determined to
conceal themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of their number, Malchus, in the disguise
of a physician, went to the town to obtain victuals.
Decius, who had been absent from Ephesus for a
little while, returned, and gave orders for the seven
to be sought. Malchus, having escaped from the
town, fled, full of fear, to his comrades, and told
them of the emperor&rsquo;s fury. They were much
alarmed; and Malchus handed them the loaves he
had bought, bidding them eat, that, fortified by the
food, they might have courage in the time of trial.
They ate, and then, as they sat weeping and speaking
to one another, by the will of God they fell
asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pagans sought everywhere, but could not
find them, and Decius was greatly irritated at their
escape. He had their parents brought before him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
and threatened them with death if they did not
reveal the place of concealment; but they could
only answer that the seven young men had distributed
their goods to the poor, and that they were
quite ignorant as to their whereabouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decius, thinking it possible that they might be
hiding in a cavern, blocked up the mouth with
stones, that they might perish of hunger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three hundred and sixty years passed, and in
the thirtieth year of the reign of Theodosius, there
broke forth a heresy denying the resurrection of
the dead....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, it happened that an Ephesian was building
a stable on the side of Mount Celion, and finding
a pile of stones handy, he took them for his edifice,
and thus opened the mouth of the cave. Then the
seven sleepers awoke, and it was to them as if they
had slept but a single night. They began to ask
Malchus what decision Decius had given concerning
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is going to hunt us down, so as to force
us to sacrifice to the idols,&rsquo; was his reply. &lsquo;God
knows,&rsquo; replied Maximian, &lsquo;we shall never do that.&rsquo;
Then exhorting his companions, he urged Malchus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
to go back to the town to buy some more bread,
and at the same time to obtain fresh information.
Malchus took five coins and left the cavern. On
seeing the stones he was filled with astonishment;
however, he went on towards the city; but what
was his bewilderment, on approaching the gate, to
see over it a cross! He went to another gate, and
there he beheld the same sacred sign; and so he
observed it over each gate of the city. He believed
that he was suffering from the effects of a dream.
Then he entered Ephesus, rubbing his eyes, and he
walked to a baker&rsquo;s shop. He heard people using
our Lord&rsquo;s name, and he was the more perplexed.
&lsquo;Yesterday, no one dared pronounce the name of
Jesus, and now it is on every one&rsquo;s lips. Wonderful!
I can hardly believe myself to be in Ephesus.&rsquo;
He asked a passer-by the name of the city, and on
being told it was Ephesus, he was thunderstruck.
Now he entered a baker&rsquo;s shop, and laid down his
money. The baker, examining the coin, inquired
whether he had found a treasure, and began to
whisper to some others in the shop. The youth,
thinking that he was discovered, and that they were
about to conduct him to the emperor, implored them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
to let him alone, offering to leave loaves and money
if he might only be suffered to escape. But the
shop-men, seizing him, said, &lsquo;Whoever you are,
you have found a treasure; show us where it is,
that we may share it with you, and then we will
hide you.&rsquo; Malchus was too frightened to answer.
So they put a rope round his neck, and drew him
through the streets into the market-place. The news
soon spread that the young man had discovered a
great treasure, and there was presently a vast crowd
about him. He stoutly protested his innocence. No
one recognized him, and his eyes, ranging over the
faces which surrounded him, could not see one which
he had known, or which was in the slightest degree
familiar to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Martin, the bishop, and Antipater, the governor,
having heard of the excitement, ordered the
young man to be brought before them, along with
the bakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bishop and the governor asked him where
he had found the treasure, and he replied that he
had found none, but that the few coins were from
his own purse. He was next asked whence he
came. He replied that he was a native of Ephesus,
&lsquo;if this be Ephesus.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Send for your relations&mdash;your parents, if they
live here,&rsquo; ordered the governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They live here, certainly,&rsquo; replied the youth;
and he mentioned their names. No such names
were known in the town. Then the governor exclaimed,
&lsquo;How dare you say that this money
belonged to your parents when it dates back three
hundred and seventy-seven years,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and is as old as
the beginning of the reign of Decius, and it is
utterly unlike our modern coinage? Do you think
to impose on the old men and sages of Ephesus?
Believe me, I shall make you suffer the severities
of the law till you show where you made the discovery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I implore you,&rsquo; cried Malchus, &lsquo;in the name
of God, answer me a few questions, and then I
will answer yours. Where is the Emperor Decius
gone to?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bishop answered, &lsquo;My son, there is no
emperor of that name; he who was thus called
died long ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malchus replied, &lsquo;All I hear perplexes me more
and more. Follow me, and I will show you my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
comrades, who fled with me into a cave of Mount
Celion, only yesterday, to escape the cruelty of
Decius. I will lead you to them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bishop turned to the governor. &lsquo;The hand
of God is here,&rsquo; he said. Then they followed, and
a great crowd after them. And Malchus entered
first into the cavern to his companions, and the
bishop after him.... And there they saw the
martyrs seated in the cave, with their faces fresh
and blooming as roses; so all fell down and glorified
God. The bishop and the governor sent notice
to Theodosius, and he hurried to Ephesus. All
the inhabitants met him and conducted him to the
cavern. As soon as the saints beheld the emperor,
their faces shone like the sun, and the emperor
gave thanks unto God, and embraced them, and
said, &lsquo;I see you, as though I saw the Savior restoring
Lazarus.&rsquo; Maximian replied, &lsquo;Believe us! for
the faith&rsquo;s sake, God has resuscitated us before the
great resurrection day, in order that you may believe
firmly in the resurrection of the dead. For
as the child is in its mother&rsquo;s womb living and
not suffering, so have we lived without suffering,
fast asleep.&rsquo; And having thus spoken, they bowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
their heads, and their souls returned to their Maker.
The emperor, rising, bent over them and embraced
them weeping. He gave them orders for golden
reliquaries to be made, but that night they appeared
to him in a dream, and said that hitherto
they had slept in the earth, and that in the earth
they desired to sleep on till God should raise them
again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Such is the beautiful story. It seems to have
travelled to us from the East. Jacobus Sarugiensis,
a Mesopotamian bishop, in the fifth or sixth century,
is said to have been the first to commit it to
writing. Gregory of Tours (De Glor. Mart. i. 9)
was perhaps the first to introduce it to Europe.
Dionysius of Antioch (ninth century) told the story
in Syrian, and Photius of Constantinople reproduced
it, with the remark that Mahomet had
adopted it into the Koran. Metaphrastus alludes
to it as well; in the tenth century Eutychius inserted
it in his annals of Arabia; it is found in
the Coptic and the Maronite books, and several
early historians, as Paulus Diaconus, Nicephorus,
&amp;c., have inserted it in their works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
A poem on the Seven Sleepers was composed
by a trouv&egrave;re named Chardri, and is mentioned by
M. Fr. Michel in his &ldquo;Rapports Ministre de
l&rsquo;Instruction Public;&rdquo; a German poem on the same
subject, of the thirteenth century, in 935 verses, has
been published by M. Karajan; and the Spanish
poet, Augustin Morreto, composed a drama on it,
entitled &ldquo;Los Siete Durmientes,&rdquo; which is inserted
in the 19th volume of the rare work, &ldquo;Comedias
Nuevas Escogidas de los Mejores Ingenios.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mahomet has somewhat improved on the story.
He has made the Sleepers prophesy his coming,
and he has given them a dog named Kratim, or
Kratimir, which sleeps with them, and which is
endowed with the gift of prophecy.</p>

<p>As a special favor this dog is to be one of the
ten animals to be admitted into his paradise, the
others being Jonah&rsquo;s whale, Solomon&rsquo;s ant, Ishmael&rsquo;s
ram, Abraham&rsquo;s calf, the Queen of Sheba&rsquo;s
ass, the prophet Salech&rsquo;s camel, Moses&rsquo; ox, Belkis&rsquo;
cuckoo, and Mahomet&rsquo;s ass.</p>

<p>It was perhaps too much for the Seven Sleepers
to ask, that their bodies should be left to rest in
earth. In ages when saintly relics were valued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
above gold and precious stones, their request was
sure to be shelved; and so we find that their
remains were conveyed to Marseilles in a large
stone sarcophagus, which is still exhibited in St.
Victor&rsquo;s Church. In the Mus&aelig;um Victorium at
Rome is a curious and ancient representation of
them in a cement of sulphur and plaster. Their
names are engraved beside them, together with
certain attributes. Near Constantine and John are
two clubs, near Maximian a knotty club, near
Malchus and Martinian two axes, near Serapion
a burning torch, and near Danesius or Dionysius
a great nail, such as those spoken of by Horace
(Lib. 1, Od. 3) and St. Paulinus (Nat. 9, or Carm.
24) as having been used for torture.</p>

<p>In this group of figures, the seven are represented
as young, without beards, and indeed in ancient
martyrologies they are frequently called boys.</p>

<p>It has been inferred from this curious plaster
representation, that the seven may have suffered
under Decius, A.&nbsp;D. 250, and have been buried in
the afore-mentioned cave; whilst the discovery and
translation of their relics under Theodosius, in 479,
may have given rise to the fable. And this I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
probable enough. The story of long sleepers and
the number seven connected with it is ancient
enough, and dates from heathen mythology.</p>

<p>Like many another ancient myth, it was laid
hold of by Christian hands and baptized.</p>

<p>Pliny relates the story of Epimenides the epic
poet, who, when tending his sheep one hot day,
wearied and oppressed with slumber, retreated into
a cave, where he fell asleep. After fifty-seven years
he awoke, and found every thing changed. His
brother, whom he had left a stripling, was now a
hoary man.</p>

<p>Epimenides was reckoned one of the seven sages
by those who exclude Periander. He flourished in
the time of Solon. After his death, at the age of
two hundred and eighty-nine, he was revered as a
god, and honored especially by the Athenians.</p>

<p>This story is a version of the older legend of
the perpetual sleep of the shepherd Endymion, who
was thus preserved in unfading youth and beauty
by Jupiter.</p>

<p>According to an Arabic legend, St. George thrice
rose from his grave, and was thrice slain.</p>

<p>In Scandinavian mythology we have Siegfrid or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
Sigurd thus resting, and awaiting his call to come
forth and fight. Charlemagne sleeps in the Odenberg
in Hess, or in the Untersberg near Salzburg,
seated on his throne, with his crown on his head
and his sword at his side, waiting till the times
of Antichrist are fulfilled, when he will wake and
burst forth to avenge the blood of the saints. Ogier
the Dane, or Olger Dansk, will in like manner
shake off his slumber and come forth from the
dream-land of Avallon to avenge the right&mdash;O
that he had shown himself in the Schleswig-Holstein
war!</p>

<p>Well do I remember, as a child, contemplating
with wondering awe the great Kyffh&auml;userberg in
Thuringia, for therein, I was told, slept Frederic
Barbarossa and his six knights. A shepherd once
penetrated into the heart of the mountain by a
cave, and discovered therein a hall where sat the
emperor at a stone table, and his red beard had
grown through the slab. At the tread of the
shepherd Frederic awoke from his slumber, and
asked, &ldquo;Do the ravens still fly over the mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire, they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then we must sleep another hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when his beard has wound itself thrice
round the table, then will the emperor awake
with his knights, and rush forth to release Germany
from its bondage, and exalt it to the first
place among the kingdoms of Europe.</p>

<p>In Switzerland slumber three Tells at Rutli, near
the Vierwaldst&auml;tter-see, waiting for the hour of
their country&rsquo;s direst need. A shepherd crept into
the cave where they rest. The third Tell rose
and asked the time. &ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; replied the shepherd
lad. &ldquo;The time is not yet come,&rdquo; said Tell, and
lay down again.</p>

<p>In Scotland, beneath the Eilden hills, sleeps
Thomas of Erceldoune; the murdered French who
fell in the Sicilian Vespers at Palermo are also
slumbering till the time is come when they may
wake to avenge themselves. When Constantinople
fell into the hands of the Turks, a priest was
celebrating the sacred mysteries at the great silver
altar of St. Sophia. The celebrant cried to God to
protect the sacred host from profanation. Then the
wall opened, and he entered, bearing the Blessed
Sacrament. It closed on him, and there he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
sleeping with his head bowed before the Body of
Our Lord, waiting till the Turk is cast out of
Constantinople, and St. Sophia is released from
its profanation. God speed the time!</p>

<p>In Bohemia sleep three miners deep in the heart
of the Kuttenberg. In North America Rip Van
Winkle passed twenty years slumbering in the
Katskill mountains. In Portugal it is believed
that Sebastian, the chivalrous young monarch who
did his best to ruin his country by his rash invasion
of Morocco, is sleeping somewhere; but he
will wake again to be his country&rsquo;s deliverer in the
hour of need. Olaf Tryggvason is waiting a similar
occasion in Norway. Even Napoleon Bonaparte
is believed among some of the French peasantry
to be sleeping on in a like manner.</p>

<p>St. Hippolytus relates that St. John the Divine
is slumbering at Ephesus, and Sir John Mandeville
relates the circumstances as follows: &ldquo;From
Pathmos men gone unto Ephesim a fair citee and
nyghe to the see. And there dyede Seynte Johne,
and was buryed behynde the highe Awtiere, in
a toumbe. And there is a faire chirche. For
Christene mene weren wont to holden that place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
alweyes. And in the tombe of Seynt John is
noughte but manna, that is clept Aungeles mete.
For his body was translated into Paradys. And
Turkes holden now alle that place and the citee
and the Chirche. And all Asie the lesse is yclept
Turkye. And ye shalle undrestond, that Seynt
Johne bid make his grave there in his Lyf, and
leyd himself there-inne all quyk. And therefore
somme men seyn, that he dyed noughte, but that
he resteth there till the Day of Doom. And forsoothe
there is a gret marveule: For men may see
there the erthe of the tombe apertly many tymes
steren and moven, as there weren quykke thinges
undre.&rdquo; The connection of this legend of St. John
with Ephesus may have had something to do with
turning the seven martyrs of that city into seven
sleepers.</p>

<p>The annals of Iceland relate that, in 1403, a Finn
of the name of Fethmingr, living in Halogaland, in
the North of Norway, happening to enter a cave,
fell asleep, and woke not for three whole years,
lying with his bow and arrows at his side, untouched
by bird or beast.</p>

<p>There certainly are authentic accounts of persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
having slept for an extraordinary length of time,
but I shall not mention any, as I believe the legend
we are considering, not to have been an exaggeration
of facts, but a Christianized myth of paganism.
The fact of the number seven being so prominent
in many of the tales, seems to lead to this conclusion.
Barbarossa changes his position every
seven years. Charlemagne starts in his chair at
similar intervals. Olger Dansk stamps his iron
mace on the floor once every seven years. Olaf
Redbeard in Sweden uncloses his eyes at precisely
the same distances of time.</p>

<p>I believe that the mythological core of this picturesque
legend is the repose of the earth through
the seven winter months. In the North, Frederic
and Charlemagne certainly replace Odin.</p>

<p>The German and Scandinavian still heathen legends
represent the heroes as about to issue forth
for the defence of Fatherland in the hour of direst
need. The converted and Christianized tale brings
the martyr youths forth in the hour when a heresy
is afflicting the Church, that they may destroy the
heresy by their witness to the truth of the Resurrection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
If there is something majestic in the heathen
myth, there are singular grace and beauty in the
Christian tale, teaching, as it does, such a glorious
doctrine; but it is surpassed in delicacy by the
modern form which the same myth has assumed&mdash;a
form which is a real transformation, leaving the
doctrine taught the same. It has been made into
a romance by Hoffman, and is versified by Trinius.
I may perhaps be allowed to translate with some
freedom the poem of the latter:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>William Tell.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> SUPPOSE that most people regard William
Tell, the hero of Switzerland, as an historical
character, and visit the scenes made memorable by
his exploits, with corresponding interest, when they
undertake the regular Swiss round.</p>

<p>It is one of the painful duties of the antiquarian
to dispel many a popular belief, and to probe the
groundlessness of many an historical statement. The
antiquarian is sometimes disposed to ask with Pilate,
&ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo; when he finds historical
facts crumbling beneath his touch into mythological
fables; and he soon learns to doubt and question
the most emphatic declarations of, and claims to,
reliability.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, in his prison, was composing
the second volume of his History of the World.
Leaning on the sill of his window, he meditated
on the duties of the historian to mankind, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
suddenly his attention was attracted by a disturbance
in the court-yard before his cell. He saw
one man strike another whom he supposed by his
dress to be an officer; the latter at once drew his
sword, and ran the former through the body. The
wounded man felled his adversary with a stick,
and then sank upon the pavement. At this juncture
the guard came up, and carried off the officer
insensible, and then the corpse of the man who
had been run through.</p>

<p>Next day Raleigh was visited by an intimate
friend, to whom he related the circumstances of
the quarrel and its issue. To his astonishment,
his friend unhesitatingly declared that the prisoner
had mistaken the whole series of incidents which
had passed before his eyes.</p>

<p>The supposed officer was not an officer at all,
but the servant of a foreign ambassador; it was he
who had dealt the first blow; he had not drawn
his sword, but the other had snatched it from his
side, and had run <em>him</em> through the body before
any one could interfere; whereupon a stranger
from among the crowd knocked the murderer
down with his stick, and some of the foreigners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
belonging to the ambassador&rsquo;s retinue carried off
the corpse. The friend of Raleigh added that
government had ordered the arrest and immediate
trial of the murderer, as the man assassinated was
one of the principal servants of the Spanish ambassador.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Raleigh, &ldquo;but I cannot have
been deceived as you suppose, for I was eye-witness
to the events which took place under my
own window, and the man fell there on that spot
where you see a paving-stone standing up above
the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Raleigh,&rdquo; replied his friend, &ldquo;I was
sitting on that stone when the fray took place, and
I received this slight scratch on my cheek in
snatching the sword from the murderer; and upon
my word of honor, you have been deceived upon
every particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Walter, when alone, took up the second
volume of his History, which was in MS., and
contemplating it, thought&mdash;&ldquo;If I cannot believe
my own eyes, how can I be assured of the truth
of a tithe of the events which happened ages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
before I was born?&rdquo; and he flung the manuscript

<p>Now, I think that I can show that the story of
William Tell is as fabulous as&mdash;what shall I say?
any other historical event.</p>

<p>It is almost too well known to need repetition.</p>

<p>In the year 1307, Gessler, Vogt of the Emperor
Albert of Hapsburg, set a hat on a pole, as symbol
of imperial power, and ordered every one who
passed by to do obeisance towards it. A mountaineer
of the name of Tell boldly traversed the
space before it without saluting the abhorred symbol.
By Gessler&rsquo;s command he was at once seized
and brought before him. As Tell was known to
be an expert archer, he was ordered, by way of
punishment, to shoot an apple off the head of his
own son. Finding remonstrance vain, he submitted.
The apple was placed on the child&rsquo;s head,
Tell bent his bow, the arrow sped, and apple and
arrow fell together to the ground. But the Vogt noticed
that Tell, before shooting, had stuck another
arrow into his belt, and he inquired the reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
&ldquo;It was for you,&rdquo; replied the sturdy archer.
&ldquo;Had I shot my child, know that it would not
have missed your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This event, observe, took place in the beginning
of the fourteenth century. But Saxo Grammaticus,
a Danish writer of the twelfth century, tells the
story of a hero of his own country, who lived in
the tenth century. He relates the incident in horrible
style as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor ought what follows to be enveloped in
silence. Toki, who had for some time been in the
king&rsquo;s service, had, by his deeds, surpassing those
of his comrades, made enemies of his virtues. One
day, when he had drunk too much, he boasted to
those who sat at table with him, that his skill in
archery was such, that with the first shot of an
arrow he could hit the smallest apple set on the
top of a stick at a considerable distance. His detractors,
hearing this, lost no time in conveying
what he had said to the king (Harald Bluetooth).
But the wickedness of this monarch soon transformed
the confidence of the father to the jeopardy
of the son, for he ordered the dearest pledge of his
life to stand in place of the stick, from whom, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
the utterer of the boast did not at his first shot
strike down the apple, he should with his head
pay the penalty of having made an idle boast. The
command of the king urged the soldier to do this,
which was so much more than he had undertaken,
the detracting artifices of the others having
taken advantage of words spoken when he was
hardly sober. As soon as the boy was led forth,
Toki carefully admonished him to receive the
whir of the arrow as calmly as possible, with attentive
ears, and without moving his head, lest
by a slight motion of the body he should frustrate
the experience of his well-tried skill. He also
made him stand with his back towards him, lest
he should be frightened at the sight of the arrow.
Then he drew three arrows from his quiver, and
the very first he shot struck the proposed mark.
Toki being asked by the king why he had taken
so many more arrows out of his quiver, when he
was to make but one trial with his bow, &lsquo;That I
might avenge on thee,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;the error of the
first, by the points of the others, lest my innocence
might happen to be afflicted, and thy injustice go
unpunished.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
The same incident is told of Egil, brother of the
mythical Velundr, in the Saga of Thidrik.</p>

<p>In Norwegian history also it appears with variations
again and again. It is told of King Olaf the
Saint (d. 1030), that, desiring the conversion of a
brave heathen named Eindridi, he competed with
him in various athletic sports; he swam with
him, wrestled, and then shot with him. The king
dared Eindridi to strike a writing-tablet from off
his son&rsquo;s head with an arrow. Eindridi prepared
to attempt the difficult shot. The king bade two
men bind the eyes of the child and hold the
napkin, so that he might not move when he heard
the whistle of the arrow. The king aimed first,
and the arrow grazed the lad&rsquo;s head. Eindridi
then prepared to shoot; but the mother of the boy
interfered, and persuaded the king to abandon this
dangerous test of skill. In this version, also, Eindridi
is prepared to revenge himself on the king,
should the child be injured.</p>

<p>But a closer approximation still to the Tell myth
is found in the life of Hemingr, another Norse
archer, who was challenged by King Harald,
Sigurd&rsquo;s son (d. 1066). The story is thus told:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
&ldquo;The island was densely overgrown with wood,
and the people went into the forest. The king
took a spear and set it with its point in the soil,
then he laid an arrow on the string and shot up
into the air. The arrow turned in the air and
came down upon the spear-shaft and stood up in
it. Hemingr took another arrow and shot up; his
was lost to sight for some while, but it came back
and pierced the nick of the king&rsquo;s arrow....
Then the king took a knife and stuck it into an
oak; he next drew his bow and planted an arrow
in the haft of the knife. Thereupon Hemingr took
his arrows. The king stood by him and said,
&lsquo;They are all inlaid with gold; you are a capital
workman.&rsquo; Hemingr answered, &lsquo;They are not my
manufacture, but are presents.&rsquo; He shot, and his
arrow cleft the haft, and the point entered the
socket of the blade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must have a keener contest,&rsquo; said the
king, taking an arrow and flushing with anger;
then he laid the arrow on the string and drew his
bow to the farthest, so that the horns were nearly
brought to meet. Away flashed the arrow, and
pierced a tender twig. All said that this was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
most astonishing feat of dexterity. But Hemingr
shot from a greater distance, and split a hazel nut.
All were astonished to see this. Then said the king,
&lsquo;Take a nut and set it on the head of your brother
Bjorn, and aim at it from precisely the same distance.
If you miss the mark, then your life goes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hemingr answered, &lsquo;Sire, my life is at your
disposal, but I will not adventure that shot.&rsquo; Then
out spake Bjorn&mdash;&lsquo;Shoot, brother, rather than die
yourself.&rsquo; Hemingr said, &lsquo;Have you the pluck to
stand quite still without shrinking?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will do my
best,&rsquo; said Bjorn. &lsquo;Then let the king stand by,&rsquo; said
Hemingr, &lsquo;and let him see whether I touch the nut.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king agreed, and bade Oddr Ufeigs&rsquo; son
stand by Bjorn, and see that the shot was fair.
Hemingr then went to the spot fixed for him by
the king, and signed himself with the cross, saying,
&lsquo;God be my witness that I had rather die myself
than injure my brother Bjorn; let all the blame rest
on King Harald.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Hemingr flung his spear. The spear went
straight to the mark, and passed between the nut and
the crown of the lad, who was not in the least injured.
It flew farther, and stopped not till it fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then the king came up and asked Oddr what he
thought about the shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Years after, this risk was revenged upon the hard-hearted
monarch. In the battle of Stamfordbridge
an arrow from a skilled archer penetrated the windpipe
of the king, and it is supposed to have sped,
observes the Saga writer, from the bow of Hemingr,
then in the service of the English monarch.</p>

<p>The story is related somewhat differently in the
Faroe Isles, and is told of Geyti, Aslak&rsquo;s son. The
same Harald asks his men if they know who is his
match in strength. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they reply; &ldquo;there is a
peasant&rsquo;s son in the uplands, Geyti, son of Aslak, who
is the strongest of men.&rdquo; Forth goes the king, and at
last rides up to the house of Aslak. &ldquo;And where is
your youngest son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! he lies under the green sod of Kolrin
kirkgarth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, then, and show me his corpse,
old man, that I may judge whether he was as stout
of limb as men say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father puts the king off with the excuse that
among so many dead it would be hard to find his
boy. So the king rides away over the heath. He
meets a stately man returning from the chase, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
a bow over his shoulder. &ldquo;And who art thou,
friend?&rdquo; &ldquo;Geyti, Aslak&rsquo;s son.&rdquo; The dead man,
in short, alive and well. The king tells him he has
heard of his prowess, and is come to match his
strength with him. So Geyti and the king try a
swimming-match.</p>

<p>The king swims well; but Geyti swims better, and
in the end gives the monarch such a ducking, that he
is borne to his house devoid of sense and motion.
Harald swallows his anger, as he had swallowed the
water, and bids Geyti shoot a hazel nut from off his
brother&rsquo;s head. Aslak&rsquo;s son consents, and invites the
king into the forest to witness his dexterity.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A very similar tale is told also in the celebrated
Malleus Maleficarum of a man named Puncher, with
this difference, that a coin is placed on the lad&rsquo;s head
instead of an apple or a nut. The person who had
dared Puncher to the test of skill, inquires the use
of the second arrow in his belt, and receives the usual
answer, that if the first arrow had missed the coin,
the second would have transfixed a certain heart
which was destitute of natural feeling.</p>

<p>We have, moreover, our English version of the
same story in the venerable ballad of William of
Cloudsley.</p>

<p>The Finn ethnologist Castr&eacute;n obtained the following
tale in the Finnish village of Uhtuwa:&mdash;</p>

<p>A fight took place between some freebooters and
the inhabitants of the village of Alaj&auml;wi. The robbers
plundered every house, and carried off amongst
their captives an old man. As they proceeded with
their spoils along the strand of the lake, a lad of
twelve years old appeared from among the reeds on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
the opposite bank, armed with a bow, and amply
provided with arrows; he threatened to shoot down
the captors unless the old man, his father, were restored
to him. The robbers mockingly replied that
the aged man would be given to him if he could shoot
an apple off his head. The boy accepted the challenge,
and on successfully accomplishing it, the surrender
of the venerable captive was made.</p>

<p>Farid-Uddin &Acirc;ttar was a Persian dealer in perfumes,
born in the year 1119. He one day was so
impressed with the sight of a dervish, that he sold his
possessions, and followed righteousness. He composed
the poem Mantic Utta&iuml;r, or the language of
birds. Observe, the Persian &Acirc;ttar lived at the same
time as the Danish Saxo, and long before the birth
of Tell. Curiously enough, we find a trace of the
Tell myth in the pages of his poem. According to
him, however, the king shoots the apple from the
head of a beloved page, and the lad dies from sheer
fright, though the arrow does not even graze his
skin.</p>

<p>The coincidence of finding so many versions of the
same story scattered through countries as remote as
Persia and Iceland, Switzerland and Denmark, proves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
I think, that it can in no way be regarded as history,
but is rather one of the numerous household myths
common to the whole stock of Aryan nations. Probably,
some one more acquainted with Sanskrit literature
than myself, and with better access to its unpublished
stores of fable and legend, will some day light
on an early Indian tale corresponding to that so
prevalent among other branches of the same family.
The coincidence of the Tell myth being discovered
among the Finns is attributable to Russian or Swedish
influence. I do not regard it as a primeval Turanian,
but as an Aryan story, which, like an erratic block,
is found deposited on foreign soil far from the mountain
whence it was torn.</p>

<p>German mythologists, I suppose, consider the myth
to represent the manifestation of some natural phenomena,
and the individuals of the story to be impersonifications
of natural forces. Most primeval stories
were thus constructed, and their origin is traceable
enough. In Thorn-rose, for instance, who can fail
to see the earth goddess represented by the sleeping
beauty in her long winter slumber, only returning to
life when kissed by the golden-haired sun-god Ph&oelig;bus
or Baldur? But the Tell myth has not its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
signification thus painted on the surface; and those who
suppose Gessler or Harald to be the power of evil
and darkness,&mdash;the bold archer to be the storm-cloud
with his arrow of lightning and his iris bow, bent
against the sun, which is resting like a coin or a
golden apple on the edge of the horizon, are over-straining
their theories, and exacting too much from
our credulity.</p>

<p>In these pages and elsewhere I have shown how
some of the ancient myths related by the whole
Aryan family of nations are reducible to allegorical
explanations of certain well-known natural phenomena;
but I must protest against the manner in
which our German friends fasten rapaciously upon
every atom of history, sacred and profane, and demonstrate
all heroes to represent the sun; all villains
to be the demons of night or winter; all sticks and
spears and arrows to be the lightning; all cows
and sheep and dragons and swans to be clouds.</p>

<p>In a work on the superstition of Werewolves, I
have entered into this subject with some fulness,
and am quite prepared to admit the premises upon
which mythologists construct their theories; at the
same time I am not disposed to run to the extravagant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
lengths reached by some of the most enthusiastic
German scholars. A wholesome warning to these
gentlemen was given some years ago by an ingenious
French ecclesiastic, who wrote the following argument
to prove that Napoleon Bonaparte was a mythological
character. Archbishop Whately&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historic
Doubts&rdquo; was grounded on a totally different line of
argument; I subjoin the other, as a curiosity and as
a caution.</p>

<p>Napoleon is, says the writer, an impersonification
of the sun.</p>

<p>1. Between the name Napoleon and Apollo, or
Apoleon, the god of the sun, there is but a trifling
difference; indeed, the seeming difference is lessened,
if we take the spelling of his name from the column
of the Place Vend&ocirc;me, where it stands N&eacute;apole&oacute;.
But this syllable <em>Ne</em> prefixed to the name of the sun-god
is of importance; like the rest of the name it is
of Greek origin, and is <ins class="greek" title="n&ecirc;">&#957;&#951;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="nai">&#957;&#945;&#953;</ins>, a particle of affirmation,
as though indicating Napoleon as the very true
Apollo, or sun.</p>

<p>His other name, Bonaparte, makes this apparent
connection between the French hero and the luminary
of the firmament conclusively certain. The day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
has its two parts, the good and luminous portion, and
that which is bad and dark. To the sun belongs the
good part, to the moon and stars belongs the bad
portion. It is therefore natural that Apollo or N&eacute;-Apole&oacute;n
should receive the surname of <em>Bonaparte</em>.</p>

<p>2. Apollo was born in Delos, a Mediterranean
island; Napoleon in Corsica, an island in the same
sea. According to Pausanias, Apollo was an Egyptian
deity; and in the mythological history of the
fabulous Napoleon we find the hero in Egypt, regarded
by the inhabitants with veneration, and
receiving their homage.</p>

<p>3. The mother of Napoleon was said to be Letitia,
which signifies joy, and is an impersonification of
the dawn of light dispensing joy and gladness to all
creation. Letitia is no other than the break of day,
which in a manner brings the sun into the world, and
&ldquo;with rosy fingers opes the gates of Day.&rdquo; It is significant
that the Greek name for the mother of Apollo
was Leto. From this the Romans made the name
Latona, which they gave to his mother. But <i>L&aelig;to</i> is
the unused form of the verb <i>l&aelig;tor</i>, and signified to
inspire joy; it is from this unused form that the substantive
<i>Letitia</i> is derived. The identity, then, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
the mother of Napoleon with the Greek Leto and the
Latin Latona, is established conclusively.</p>

<p>4. According to the popular story, this son of
Letitia had three sisters; and was it not the same
with the Greek deity, who had the three Graces?</p>

<p>5. The modern Gallic Apollo had four brothers.
It is impossible not to discern here the anthropomorphosis
of the four seasons. But, it will be objected,
the seasons should be females. Here the French
language interposes; for in French the seasons are
masculine, with the exception of autumn, upon the
gender of which grammarians are undecided, whilst
Autumnus in Latin is not more feminine than the
other seasons. This difficulty is therefore trifling,
and what follows removes all shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>Of the four brothers of Napoleon, three are said
to have been kings, and these of course are, Spring
reigning over the flowers, Summer reigning over the
harvest, Autumn holding sway over the fruits. And
as these three seasons owe all to the powerful influence
of the Sun, we are told in the popular myth
that the three brothers of Napoleon drew their
authority from him, and received from him their
kingdoms. But if it be added that, of the four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
brothers of Napoleon, one was not a king, that was
because he is the impersonification of Winter, which
has no reign over anything. If, however, it be asserted,
in contradiction, that the winter has an empire,
he will be given the principality over snows
and frosts, which, in the dreary season of the year,
whiten the face of the earth. Well, the fourth
brother of Napoleon is thus invested by popular
tradition, commonly called history, with a vain principality
accorded to him <em>in the decline of the power
of Napoleon</em>. The principality was that of Canino,
a name derived from <i>cani</i>, or the whitened hairs of
a frozen old age,&mdash;true emblem of winter. To the
eyes of poets, the forests covering the hills are their
hair, and when winter frosts them, they represent
the snowy locks of a decrepit nature in the old age
of the year:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cum gelidus crescit <i>canis</i> in montibus humor.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Consequently the Prince of Canino is an impersonification
of winter;&mdash;winter whose reign begins
when the kingdoms of the three fine seasons are
passed from them, and when the sun is driven from
his power by the children of the North, as the poets
call the boreal winds. This is the origin of the fabulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
invasion of France by the allied armies of the
North. The story relates that these invaders&mdash;the
northern gales&mdash;banished the many-colored flag, and
replaced it by a white standard. This too is a graceful,
but, at the same time, purely fabulous account
of the Northern winds driving all the brilliant colors
from the face of the soil, to replace them by the
snowy sheet.</p>

<p>6. Napoleon is said to have had two wives. It is
well known that the classic fable gave two also to
Apollo. These two were the moon and the earth.
Plutarch asserts that the Greeks gave the moon to
Apollo for wife, whilst the Egyptians attributed to
him the earth. By the moon he had no posterity,
but by the other he had one son only, the little
Horus. This is an Egyptian allegory, representing
the fruits of agriculture produced by the earth fertilized
by the Sun. The pretended son of the fabulous
Napoleon is said to have been born on the 20th
of March, the season of the spring equinox, when
agriculture is assuming its greatest period of activity.</p>

<p>7. Napoleon is said to have released France from
the devastating scourge which terrorized over the
country, the hydra of the revolution, as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
popularly called. Who cannot see in this a Gallic version
of the Greek legend of Apollo releasing Hellas
from the terrible Python? The very name <em>revolution</em>,
derived from the Latin verb <i>revolvo</i>, is indicative
of the coils of a serpent like the Python.</p>

<p>8. The famous hero of the 19th century had, it is
asserted, twelve Marshals at the head of his armies,
and four who were stationary and inactive. The
twelve first, as may be seen at once, are the signs
of the zodiac, marching under the orders of the sun
Napoleon, and each commanding a division of the
innumerable host of stars, which are parted into
twelve portions, corresponding to the twelve signs.
As for the four stationary officers, immovable in the
midst of general motion, they are the cardinal points.</p>

<p>9. It is currently reported that the chief of these
brilliant armies, after having gloriously traversed the
Southern kingdoms, penetrated North, and was there
unable to maintain his sway. This too represents
the course of the Sun, which assumes its greatest
power in the South, but after the spring equinox
seeks to reach the North; and after a <em>three months&rsquo;</em>
march towards the boreal regions, is driven back
upon his traces following the sign of Cancer, a sign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
given to represent the retrogression of the sun in that
portion of the sphere. It is on this that the story of
the march of Napoleon towards Moscow, and his
humbling retreat, is founded.</p>

<p>10. Finally, the sun rises in the East and sets in
the Western sea. The poets picture him rising out
of the waters in the East, and setting in the ocean
after his twelve hours&rsquo; reign in the sky. Such is
the history of Napoleon, coming from his Mediterranean
isle, holding the reins of government for
twelve years, and finally disappearing in the mysterious
regions of the great Atlantic.</p>

<p>To those who see in Samson, the image of the
sun, the correlative of the classic Hercules, this
clever skit of the accomplished French Abb&eacute; may
prove of value as a caution.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>The Dog Gellert.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>AVING demolished William Tell, I proceed
to the destruction of another article of popular
belief.</p>

<p>Who that has visited Snowdon has not seen the
grave of Llewellyn&rsquo;s faithful hound Gellert, and been
told by the guide the touching story of the death of
the noble animal? How can we doubt the facts,
seeing that the place, Beth-Gellert, is named after
the dog, and that the grave is still visible? But
unfortunately for the truth of the legend, its pedigree
can be traced with the utmost precision.</p>

<p>The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Welsh Prince Llewellyn had a noble deerhound,
Gellert, whom he trusted to watch the cradle
of his baby son whilst he himself was absent.</p>

<p>One day, on his return, to his intense horror, he
beheld the cradle empty and upset, the clothes dabbled
with blood, and Gellert&rsquo;s mouth dripping with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
gore. Concluding hastily that the hound had proved
unfaithful, had fallen on the child and devoured it,&mdash;in
a paroxysm of rage the prince drew his sword
and slew the dog. Next instant the cry of the babe
from behind the cradle showed him that the child
was uninjured; and, on looking farther, Llewellyn
discovered the body of a huge wolf, which had entered
the house to seize and devour the child, but
which had been kept off and killed by the brave
dog Gellert.</p>

<p>In his self-reproach and grief, the prince erected
a stately monument to Gellert, and called the place
where he was buried after the poor hound&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Now, I find in Russia precisely the same story
told, with just the same appearance of truth, of a
Czar Piras. In Germany it appears with considerable
variations. A man determines on slaying his
old dog Sultan, and consults with his wife how this
is to be effected. Sultan overhears the conversation,
and complains bitterly to the wolf, who suggests an
ingenious plan by which the master may be induced
to spare his dog. Next day, when the man is going
to his work, the wolf undertakes to carry off the child
from its cradle. Sultan is to attack him and rescue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
the infant. The plan succeeds admirably, and the
dog spends his remaining years in comfort. (Grimm,
K.&nbsp;M. 48.)</p>

<p>But there is a story in closer conformity to that
of Gellert among the French collections of fabliaux
made by Le Grand d&rsquo;Aussy and Ed&eacute;l&eacute;stand du M&eacute;ril.
It became popular through the &ldquo;Gesta Romanorum,&rdquo;
a collection of tales made by the monks for harmless
reading, in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Gesta&rdquo; the tale is told as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Folliculus, a knight, was fond of hunting and
tournaments. He had an only son, for whom three
nurses were provided. Next to this child, he loved
his falcon and his greyhound. It happened one
day that he was called to a tournament, whither
his wife and domestics went also, leaving the child
in the cradle, the greyhound lying by him, and the
falcon on his perch. A serpent that inhabited a
hole near the castle, taking advantage of the profound
silence that reigned, crept from his habitation,
and advanced towards the cradle to devour
the child. The falcon, perceiving the danger, fluttered
with his wings till he awoke the dog, who
instantly attacked the invader, and after a fierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
conflict, in which he was sorely wounded, killed
him. He then lay down on the ground to lick
and heal his wounds. When the nurses returned,
they found the cradle overturned, the child thrown
out, and the ground covered with blood, as was also
the dog, who they immediately concluded had killed
the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terrified at the idea of meeting the anger of
the parents, they determined to escape; but in their
flight fell in with their mistress, to whom they were
compelled to relate the supposed murder of the
child by the greyhound. The knight soon arrived
to hear the sad story, and, maddened with fury,
rushed forward to the spot. The poor wounded
and faithful animal made an effort to rise and welcome
his master with his accustomed fondness; but
the enraged knight received him on the point of
his sword, and he fell lifeless to the ground. On
examination of the cradle, the infant was found
alive and unhurt, with the dead serpent lying by
him. The knight now perceived what had happened,
lamented bitterly over his faithful dog, and
blamed himself for having too hastily depended on
the words of his wife. Abandoning the profession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
of arms, he broke his lance in pieces, and vowed
a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he spent
the rest of his days in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monkish hit at the wife is amusing, and
might have been supposed to have originated with
those determined misogynists, as the gallant Welshmen
lay all the blame on the man. But the good
compilers of the &ldquo;Gesta&rdquo; wrote little of their own,
except moral applications of the tales they relate,
and the story of Folliculus and his dog, like many
others in their collection, is drawn from a foreign
source.</p>

<p>It occurs in the Seven Wise Masters, and in the
&ldquo;Calumnia Novercalis&rdquo; as well, so that it must
have been popular throughout medi&aelig;val Europe.
Now, the tales of the Seven Wise Masters are translations
from a Hebrew work, the Kalilah and Dimnah
of Rabbi Joel, composed about A.&nbsp;D. 1250, or
from Simeon Seth&rsquo;s Greek Kylile and Dimne, written
in 1080. These Greek and Hebrew works were
derived from kindred sources. That of Rabbi Joel
was a translation from an Arabic version made by
Nasr-Allah in the twelfth century, whilst Simeon
Seth&rsquo;s was a translation of the Persian Kalilah and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
Dimnah. But the Persian Kalilah and Dimnah
was not either an original work; it was in turn a
translation from the Sanskrit Pantschatantra, made
about A.&nbsp;D. 540.</p>

<p>In this ancient Indian book the story runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Brahmin named Devasaman had a wife, who
gave birth to a son, and also to an ichneumon.
She loved both her children dearly, giving them
alike the breast, and anointing them alike with
salves. But she feared the ichneumon might not
love his brother.</p>

<p>One day, having laid her boy in bed, she took
up the water jar, and said to her husband, &ldquo;Hear
me, master! I am going to the tank to fetch
water. Whilst I am absent, watch the boy, lest
he gets injured by the ichneumon.&rdquo; After she had
left the house, the Brahmin went forth begging,
leaving the house empty. In crept a black snake,
and attempted to bite the child; but the ichneumon
rushed at it, and tore it in pieces. Then, proud of
its achievement, it sallied forth, all bloody, to meet
its mother. She, seeing the creature stained with
blood, concluded, with feminine precipitance, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
had fallen on the baby and killed it, and she flung
her water jar at it and slew it. Only on her
return home did she ascertain her mistake.</p>

<p>The same story is also told in the Hitopadesa
(iv. 13), but the animal is an otter, not an ichneumon.
In the Arabic version a weasel takes the
place of the ichneumon.</p>

<p>The Buddhist missionaries carried the story into
Mongolia, and in the Mongolian Uligerun, which
is a translation of the Tibetian Dsanghen, the
story reappears with the pole-cat as the brave and
suffering defender of the child.</p>

<p>Stanislaus Julien, the great Chinese scholar, has
discovered the same tale in the Chinese work
entitled &ldquo;The Forest of Pearls from the Garden
of the Law.&rdquo; This work dates from 668; and in
it the creature is an ichneumon.</p>

<p>In the Persian Sindibad-n&acirc;meh is the same tale,
but the faithful animal is a cat. In Sandabar and
Syntipas it has become a dog. Through the influence
of Sandabar on the Hebrew translation of
the Kalilah and Dimnah, the ichneumon is also
replaced by a dog.</p>

<p>Such is the history of the Gellert legend; it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
an introduction into Europe from India, every step
of its transmission being clearly demonstrable.
From the Gesta Romanorum it passed into a
popular tale throughout Europe, and in different
countries it was, like the Tell myth, localized and
individualized. Many a Welsh story, such as those
contained in the Mabinogion, are as easily traced
to an Eastern origin.</p>

<p>But every story has its root. The root of the
Gellert tale is this: A man forms an alliance of
friendship with a beast or bird. The dumb animal
renders him a signal service. He misunderstands
the act, and kills his preserver.</p>

<p>We have tracked this myth under the Gellert
form from India to Wales; but under another form
it is the property of the whole Aryan family, and
forms a portion of the traditional lore of all nations
sprung from that stock.</p>

<p>Thence arose the classic fable of the peasant,
who, as he slept, was bitten by a fly. He awoke,
and in a rage killed the insect. When too late, he
observed that the little creature had aroused him
that he might avoid a snake which lay coiled up
near his pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
In the Anvar-i-Suhaili is the following kindred
tale. A king had a falcon. One day, whilst hunting,
he filled a goblet with water dropping from a
rock. As he put the vessel to his lips, his falcon
dashed upon it, and upset it with its wings. The
king, in a fury, slew the bird, and then discovered
that the water dripped from the jaws of a serpent
of the most poisonous description.</p>

<p>This story, with some variations, occurs in &AElig;sop,
&AElig;lian, and Apthonius. In the Greek fable, a
peasant liberates an eagle from the clutches of a
dragon. The dragon spirts poison into the water
which the peasant is about to drink, without observing
what the monster had done. The grateful
eagle upsets the goblet with his wings.</p>

<p>The story appears in Egypt under a whimsical
form. A Wali once smashed a pot full of herbs
which a cook had prepared. The exasperated cook
thrashed the well-intentioned but unfortunate Wali
within an inch of his life, and when he returned,
exhausted with his efforts at belaboring the man,
to examine the broken pot, he discovered amongst
the herbs a poisonous snake.</p>

<p>How many brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
cousins of all degrees a little story has! And how
few of the tales we listen to can lay any claim to
originality! There is scarcely a story which I hear
which I cannot connect with some family of myths,
and whose pedigree I cannot ascertain with more
or less precision. Shakespeare drew the plots of
his plays from Boccaccio or Straparola; but these
Italians did not invent the tales they lent to the
English dramatist. King Lear does not originate
with Geofry of Monmouth, but comes from early
Indian stores of fable, whence also are derived the
Merchant of Venice and the pound of flesh, ay,
and the very incident of the three caskets.</p>

<p>But who would credit it, were it not proved by
conclusive facts, that Johnny Sands is the inheritance
of the whole Aryan family of nations, and
that Peeping Tom of Coventry peeped in India
and on the Tartar steppes ages before Lady Godiva
was born?</p>

<p>If you listen to Traviata at the opera, you have
set before you a tale which has lasted for centuries,
and which was perhaps born in India.</p>

<p>If you read in classic fable of Orpheus charming
woods and meadows, beasts and birds, with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
magic lyre, you remember to have seen the same
fable related in the Kalewala of the Finnish Wainomainen,
and in the Kaleopoeg of the Esthonian
Kalewa.</p>

<p>If you take up English history, and read of
William the Conqueror slipping as he landed on
British soil, and kissing the earth, saying he had
come to greet and claim his own, you remember
that the same story is told of Napoleon in Egypt,
of King Olaf Harold&rsquo;s son in Norway, and in
classic history of Junius Brutus on his return from
the oracle.</p>

<p>A little while ago I cut out of a Sussex newspaper
a story purporting to be the relation of a
fact which had taken place at a fixed date in
Lewes. This was the story. A tyrannical husband
locked the door against his wife, who was out
having tea with a neighbor, gossiping and scandal-mongering;
when she applied for admittance, he
pretended not to know her. She threatened to
jump into the well unless he opened the door.</p>

<p>The man, not supposing that she would carry
her threat into execution, declined, alleging that he
was in bed, and the night was chilly; besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
which he entirely disclaimed all acquaintance with
the lady who claimed admittance.</p>

<p>The wife then flung a log into a well, and secreted
herself behind the door. The man, hearing
the splash, fancied that his good lady was really in
the deeps, and forth he darted in his nocturnal
costume, which was of the lightest, to ascertain
whether his deliverance was complete. At once
the lady darted into the house, locked the door,
and, on the husband pleading for admittance, she
declared most solemnly from the window that she
did not know <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>Now, this story, I can positively assert, unless
the events of this world move in a circle, did not
happen in Lewes, or any other Sussex town.</p>

<p>It was told in the Gesta Romanorum six hundred
years ago, and it was told, may be, as many hundred
years before in India, for it is still to be found
in Sanskrit collections of tales.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>Tailed Men.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WELL remember having it impressed upon me
by a Devonshire nurse, as a little child, that all
Cornishmen were born with tails; and it was long
before I could overcome the prejudice thus early
implanted in my breast against my Cornubian neighbors.
I looked upon those who dwelt across the
Tamar as &ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; as being scarcely to be classed
with Christian people, and certainly not to be freely
associated with by tailless Devonians. I think my
eyes were first opened to the fact that I had been
deceived by a worthy bookseller of L&mdash;&mdash;, with
whom I had contracted a warm friendship, he having
at sundry times contributed pictures to my scrapbook.
I remember one day resolving to broach the
delicate subject with my tailed friend, whom I liked,
notwithstanding his caudal appendage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;, is it true that you are a Cornishman?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, my little man; born and bred in the West
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you very much; but&mdash;have you really
got a tail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the bookseller had recovered from the astonishment
which I had produced by my question, he
stoutly repudiated the charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are a Cornishman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all Cornishmen have tails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe I satisfied my own mind that the good
man had sat his off, and my nurse assured me that
such was the case with those of sedentary habits.</p>

<p>It is curious that Devonshire superstition should
attribute the tail to Cornishmen, for it was asserted
of certain men of Kent in olden times, and was referred
to Divine vengeance upon them for having
insulted St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, if we may believe
Polydore Vergil. &ldquo;There were some,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to
whom it seemed that the king&rsquo;s secret wish was, that
Thomas should be got rid of. He, indeed, as one
accounted to be an enemy of the king&rsquo;s person, was
already regarded with so little respect, nay, was
treated with so much contempt, that when he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
to Strood, which village is situated on the Medway,
the river that washes Rochester, the inhabitants of the
place, being eager to show some mark of contumely
to the prelate in his disgrace, did not scruple to cut
off the tail of the horse on which he was riding;
but by this profane and inhospitable act they covered
themselves with eternal reproach; for it so happened
after this, by the will of God, that all the offspring
born from the men who had done this thing, were
born with tails, like brute animals. But this mark
of infamy, which formerly was everywhere notorious,
has disappeared with the extinction of the race whose
fathers perpetrated this deed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Bale, the zealous reformer, and Bishop of
Ossory in Edward VI.&rsquo;s time, refers to this story,
and also mentions a variation of the scene and cause
of this ignoble punishment. He writes, quoting his
authorities, &ldquo;John Capgrave and Alexander of Esseby
sayth, that for castynge of fyshe tayles at thys
Augustyne, Dorsettshyre men had tayles ever after.
But Polydorus applieth it unto Kentish men at Stroud,
by Rochester, for cuttinge off Thomas Becket&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s
tail. Thus hath England in all other land a perpetual
infamy of tayles by theye wrytten legendes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
lyes, yet can they not well tell where to bestowe
them truely.&rdquo; Bale, a fierce and unsparing reformer,
and one who stinted not hard words, applying to
the inventors of these legends an epithet more strong
than elegant, says, &ldquo;In the legends of their sanctified
sorcerers they have diffamed the English posterity
with tails, as has been showed afore. That an Englyshman
now cannot travayle in another land by way
of marchandyse or any other honest occupyinge, but
it is most contumeliously thrown in his tethe that all
Englyshmen have tails. That uncomely note and
report have the nation gotten, without recover, by
these laisy and idle lubbers, the monkes and the
priestes, which could find no matters to advance
their canonized gains by, or their saintes, as they
call them, but manifest lies and knaveries.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Andrew Marvel also makes mention of this strange
judgment in his <i>Loyal Scot</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">

</div>

</div>

<p>It may be remembered that Lord Monboddo, a
Scotch judge of last century, and a philosopher of
some repute, though of great eccentricity, stoutly
maintained the theory that man ought to have a
tail, that the tail is a <i>desideratum</i>, and that the
abrupt termination of the spine without caudal elongation
is a sad blemish in the origination of man.
The tail, the point in which man is inferior to the
brute, what a delicate index of the mind it is! how
it expresses the passions of love and hate! how nicely
it gives token of the feelings of joy or fear which
animate the soul! But Lord Monboddo did not
consider that what the tail is to the brute, that the
eye is to man; the lack of one member is supplied
by the other. I can tell a proud man by his eye
just as truly as if he stalked past one with erect tail;
and anger is as plainly depicted in the human eye
as in the bottle-brush tail of a cat. I know a sneak
by his cowering glance, though he has not a tail
between his legs; and pleasure is evident in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
laughing eye, without there being any necessity for
a wagging brush to express it.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson paid a visit to the judge, and knocked
on the head his theory that men ought to have tails,
and actually were born with them occasionally; for
said he, &ldquo;Of a standing fact, sir, there ought to be
no controversy; if there are men with tails, catch a
<i>homo caudatus</i>.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;It is a pity to see Lord
Monboddo publish such notions as he has done&mdash;a
man of sense, and of so much elegant learning.
There would be little in a fool doing it; we should
only laugh; but, when a wise man does it, we are
sorry. Other people have strange notions, but they
conceal them. If they have tails they hide them;
but Monboddo is as jealous of his tail as a squirrel.&rdquo;
And yet Johnson seems to have been tickled with the
idea, and to have been amused with the notion of
an appendage like a tail being regarded as the complement
of human perfection. It may be remembered
how Johnson made the acquaintance of the
young Laird of Col, during his Highland tour, and
how pleased he was with him. &ldquo;Col,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is
a noble animal. He is as complete an islander as
the mind can figure. He is a farmer, a sailor, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
hunter, a fisher: he will run you down a dog; <em>if
any man has a tail</em>, it is Col.&rdquo; And notwithstanding
all his aversion to puns, the great Doctor
was fain to yield to human weakness on one occasion,
under the influence of the mirth which Monboddo&rsquo;s
name seems to have excited. Johnson
writes to Mrs. Thrale of a party he had met one
night, which he thus enumerates: &ldquo;There were
Smelt, and the Bishop of St. Asaph, who comes
to every place; and Sir Joshua, and Lord Monboddo,
and ladies <em>out of tale</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a Polish story of a witch who made a
girdle of human skin and laid it across the threshold
of a door where a marriage-feast was being
held. On the bridal pair stepping across the
girdle they were transformed into wolves. Three
years after the witch sought them out, and cast
over them dresses of fur with the hair turned outward,
whereupon they recovered their human
forms, but, unfortunately, the dress cast over the
bridegroom was too scanty, and did not extend
over his tail, so that, when he was restored to his
former condition, he retained his lupine caudal
appendage, and this became hereditary in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
family; so that all Poles with tails are lineal
descendants of the ancestor to whom this little
misfortune happened. John Struys, a Dutch traveller,
who visited the Isle of Formosa in 1677,
gives a curious story, which is worth transcribing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I visited this island,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I had
often heard tell that there were men who had long
tails, like brute beasts; but I had never been able
to believe it, and I regarded it as a thing so alien
to our nature, that I should now have difficulty in
accepting it, if my own senses had not removed
from me every pretence for doubting the fact, by
the following strange adventure: The inhabitants
of Formosa, being used to see us, were in the
habit of receiving us on terms which left nothing
to apprehend on either side; so that, although
mere foreigners, we always believed ourselves in
safety, and had grown familiar enough to ramble
at large without an escort, when grave experience
taught us that, in so doing, we were hazarding
too much. As some of our party were one day
taking a stroll, one of them had occasion to withdraw
about a stone&rsquo;s throw from the rest, who,
being at the moment engaged in an eager
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
conversation, proceeded without heeding the disappearance
of their companion. After a while, however,
his absence was observed, and the party paused,
thinking he would rejoin them. They waited
some time; but at last, tired of the delay, they
returned in the direction of the spot where they
remembered to have seen him last. Arriving there,
they were horrified to find his mangled body lying
on the ground, though the nature of the lacerations
showed that he had not had to suffer long ere
death released him. Whilst some remained to
watch the dead body, others went off in search of
the murderer; and these had not gone far, when
they came upon a man of peculiar appearance,
who, finding himself enclosed by the exploring
party, so as to make escape from them impossible,
began to foam with rage, and by cries and
wild gesticulations to intimate that he would make
any one repent the attempt who should venture to
meddle with him. The fierceness of his desperation
for a time kept our people at bay; but as his
fury gradually subsided, they gathered more closely
round him, and at length seized him. He then
soon made them understand that it was he who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
had killed their comrade, but they could not learn
from him any cause for this conduct. As the
crime was so atrocious, and, if allowed to pass
with impunity, might entail even more serious
consequences, it was determined to burn the man.
He was tied up to a stake, where he was kept
for some hours before the time of execution arrived.
It was then that I beheld what I had never
thought to see. He had a tail more than a foot
long, covered with red hair, and very like that of a
cow. When he saw the surprise that this discovery
created among the European spectators, he
informed us that his tail was the effect of climate,
for that all the inhabitants of the southern side of
the island, where they then were, were provided
with like appendages.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>After Struys, Hornemann reported that, between
the Gulf of Benin and Abyssinia, were tailed anthropophagi,
named by the natives <i>Niam-niams</i>;
and in 1849, M. Descouret, on his return from
Mecca, affirmed that such was a common report,
and added that they had long arms, low and narrow
foreheads, long and erect ears, and slim legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
Mr. Harrison, in his &ldquo;Highlands of Ethiopia,&rdquo;
alludes to the common belief among the Abyssinians,
in a pygmy race of this nature.</p>

<p>MM. Arnault and Vayssi&egrave;re, travellers in the
same country, in 1850, brought the subject before
the Academy of Sciences.</p>

<p>In 1851, M. de Castelnau gave additional details
relative to an expedition against these tailed
men. &ldquo;The Niam-niams,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;were sleeping
in the sun: the Haoussas approached, and,
falling on them, massacred them to the last man.
They had all of them tails forty centimetres long,
and from two to three in diameter. This organ is
smooth. Among the corpses were those of several
women, who were deformed in the same
manner. In all other particulars, the men were
precisely like all other negroes. They are of a
deep black, their teeth are polished, their bodies
not tattooed. They are armed with clubs and javelins;
in war they utter piercing cries. They cultivate
rice, maize, and other grain. They are fine
looking men, and their hair is not frizzled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. d&rsquo;Abbadie, another Abyssinian traveller, writing
in 1852, gives the following account from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
lips of an Abyssinian priest: &ldquo;At the distance of
fifteen days&rsquo; journey south of Herrar is a place
where all the men have tails, the length of a palm,
covered with hair, and situated at the extremity of
the spine. The females of that country are very
beautiful and are tailless. I have seen some fifteen
of these people at Besberah, and I am positive
that the tail is natural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be observed that there is a discrepancy
between the accounts of M. de Castelnau and
M. d&rsquo;Abbadie. The former accords tails to the
ladies, whilst the latter denies it. According to
the former, the tail is smooth; according to the
latter, it is covered with hair.</p>

<p>Dr. Wolf has improved on this in his &ldquo;Travels
and Adventures,&rdquo; vol. ii. 1861. &ldquo;There are men
and women in Abyssinia with tails like dogs and
horses.&rdquo; Wolf heard also from a great many
Abyssinians and Armenians (and Wolf is convinced
of the truth of it), that &ldquo;there are near
Narea, in Abyssinia, people&mdash;men and women&mdash;with
large tails, with which they are able to knock
down a horse; and there are also such people
near China.&rdquo; And in a note, &ldquo;In the College of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
Surgeons at Dublin may still be seen a human
skeleton, with a tail seven inches long! There are
many known instances of this elongation of the
caudal vertebra, as in the Poonangs in Borneo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the most interesting and circumstantial account
of the Niam-niams is that given by Dr.
Hubsch, physician to the hospitals of Constantinople.
&ldquo;It was in 1852,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that I saw for
the first time a tailed negress. I was struck with
this phenomenon, and I questioned her master, a
slave dealer. I learned from him that there exists
a tribe called Niam-niam, occupying the interior of
Africa. All the members of this tribe bear the
caudal appendage, and, as Oriental imagination is
given to exaggeration, I was assured that the tails
sometimes attained the length of two feet. That
which I observed was smooth and hairless. It was
about two inches long, and terminated in a point.
This woman was as black as ebony, her hair was
frizzled, her teeth white, large, and planted in sockets
which inclined considerably outward; her four
canine teeth were filed, her eyes bloodshot. She
ate meat raw, her clothes fidgeted her, her intellect
was on a par with that of others of her condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
&ldquo;Her master had been unable, during six months,
to sell her, notwithstanding the low figure at which
he would have disposed of her; the abhorrence
with which she was regarded was not attributed
to her tail, but to the partiality, which she was
unable to conceal, for human flesh. Her tribe fed
on the flesh of the prisoners taken from the neighboring
tribes, with whom they were constantly at
war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as one of the tribe dies, his relations,
instead of burying him, cut him up and regale
themselves upon his remains; consequently there
are no cemeteries in this land. They do not all of
them lead a wandering life, but many of them construct
hovels of the branches of trees. They make
for themselves weapons of war and of agriculture;
they cultivate maize and wheat, and keep cattle.
The Niam-niams have a language of their own, of
an entirely primitive character, though containing an
infusion of Arabic words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They live in a state of complete nudity, and
seek only to satisfy their brute appetites. There is
among them an utter disregard for morality, incest
and adultery being common. The strongest among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
them becomes the chief of the tribe; and it is he
who apportions the shares of the booty obtained in
war. It is hard to say whether they have any religion;
but in all probability they have none, as
they readily adopt any one which they are taught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to tame them altogether; their instinct
impelling them constantly to seek for human
flesh; and instances are related of slaves who have
massacred and eaten the children confided to their
charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen a man of the same race, who had
a tail an inch and a half long, covered with a few
hairs. He appeared to be thirty-five years old; he
was robust, well built, of an ebon blackness, and
had the same peculiar formation of jaw noticed
above; that is to say, the tooth sockets were inclined
outwards. Their four canine teeth are filed
down, to diminish their power of mastication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know also, at Constantinople, the son of a
physician, aged two years, who was born with a
tail an inch long; he belonged to the white Caucasian
race. One of his grandfathers possessed the
same appendage. This phenomenon is regarded generally
in the East as a sign of great brute force.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
About ten years ago, a newspaper paragraph recorded
the birth of a boy at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
provided with a tail about an inch and a quarter
long. It was asserted that the child when sucking
wagged this stump as token of pleasure.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all this testimony in favor
of tailed men and women, it is simply a matter of
impossibility for a human being to have a tail, for
the spinal vertebr&aelig; in man do not admit of elongation,
as in many animals; for the spine terminates
in the os sacrum, a large and expanded bone of
peculiar character, entirely precluding all possibility
of production to the spine as in caudate animals.</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>Antichrist and Pope Joan.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM the earliest ages of the Church, the advent
of the Man of Sin has been looked forward
to with terror, and the passages of Scripture
relating to him have been studied with solemn awe,
lest that day of wrath should come upon the Church
unawares. As events in the world&rsquo;s history took
place which seemed to be indications of the approach
of Antichrist, a great horror fell upon men&rsquo;s
minds, and their imaginations conjured up myths
which flew from mouth to mouth, and which were
implicitly believed.</p>

<p>Before speaking of these strange tales which produced
such an effect on the minds of men in the
middle ages, it will be well briefly to examine the
opinions of divines of the early ages on the passages
of Scripture connected with the coming of
the last great persecutor of the Church. Antichrist
was believed by most ancient writers to be destined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
to arise out of the tribe of Dan, a belief founded
on the prediction of Jacob, &ldquo;Dan shall be a serpent
by the way, an adder in the path&rdquo; (conf. Jeremiah
viii. 16), and on the exclamation of the dying patriarch,
when looking on his son Dan, &ldquo;I have
waited for Thy Salvation, O Lord,&rdquo; as though the
long-suffering of God had borne long with that
tribe, but in vain, and it was to be extinguished
without hope. This, indeed, is implied in the sealing
of the servants of God in their foreheads (Revelation
vii.), when twelve thousand out of every
tribe, except Dan, were seen by St. John to receive
the seal of adoption, whilst of the tribe of Dan <em>not
one</em> was sealed, as though it, to a man, had apostatized.</p>

<p>Opinions as to the nature of Antichrist were divided.
Some held that he was to be a devil in
phantom body, and of this number was Hippolytus.
Others, again, believed that he would be an incarnate
demon, true man and true devil; in fearful and
diabolical parody of the Incarnation of our Lord.
A third view was, that he would be merely a desperately
wicked man, acting upon diabolical inspirations,
just as the saints act upon divine inspirations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
St. John Damascene expressly asserts that he will
not be an incarnate demon, but a devilish man;
for he says, &ldquo;Not as Christ assumed humanity, so
will the devil become human, but the Man will
receive all the inspiration of Satan, and will suffer
the devil to take up his abode within him.&rdquo; In
this manner Antichrist could have many forerunners;
and so St. Jerome and St. Augustine saw an Antichrist
in Nero, not <em>the</em> Antichrist, but one of those
of whom the Apostle speaks&mdash;&ldquo;Even now are there
many Antichrists.&rdquo; Thus also every enemy of the
faith, such as Diocletian, Julian, and Mahomet, has
been regarded as a precursor of the Arch-persecutor,
who was expected to sum up in himself the cruelty
of a Nero or Diocletian, the show of virtue of a
Julian, and the spiritual pride of a Mahomet.</p>

<p>From infancy the evil one is to take possession
of Antichrist, and to train him for his office, instilling
into him cunning, cruelty, and pride. His
doctrine will be&mdash;not downright infidelity, but a
&ldquo;show of godliness,&rdquo; whilst &ldquo;denying the power
thereof;&rdquo; i.&nbsp;e., the miraculous origin and divine authority
of Christianity. He will sow doubts of our
Lord&rsquo;s manifestation &ldquo;in the flesh,&rdquo; he will allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
Christ to be an excellent Man, capable of teaching
the most exalted truths, and inculcating the purest
morality, yet Himself fallible and carried away by
fanaticism.</p>

<p>In the end, however, Antichrist will &ldquo;exalt himself
to sit as God in the temple of God,&rdquo; and become
&ldquo;the abomination of desolation standing in
the holy place.&rdquo; At the same time there is to be
an awful alliance struck between himself, the impersonification
of the world-power and the Church
of God; some high pontiff of which, or the episcopacy
in general, will enter into league with the
unbelieving state to oppress the very elect. It is
a strange instance of religionary virulence which
makes some detect the Pope of Rome in the Man
of Sin, the Harlot, the Beast, and the Priest going
before it. The Man of Sin and the Beast are unmistakably
identical, and refer to an Antichristian
world-power; whilst the Harlot and the Priest are
symbols of an apostasy in the Church. There is
nothing Roman in this, but something very much
the opposite.</p>

<p>How the Abomination of Desolation can be considered
as set up in a Church where every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
sanctuary is adorned with all that can draw the heart
to the Crucified, and raise the thoughts to the
imposing ritual of Heaven, is a puzzle to me. To
the man uninitiated in the law that Revelation is
to be interpreted by contraries, it would seem more
like the Abomination of Desolation in the Holy
Place if he entered a Scotch Presbyterian, or a
Dutch Calvinist, place of worship. Rome does
not fight against the Daily Sacrifice, and endeavor
to abolish it; that has been rather the labor of so-called
Church Reformers, who with the suppression
of the doctrine of Eucharistic Sacrifice and Sacramental
Adoration have well nigh obliterated all
notion of worship to be addressed to the God-Man.
Rome does not deny the power of the godliness
of which she makes show, but insists on that power
with no broken accents. It is rather in other communities,
where authority is flung aside, and any
man is permitted to believe or reject what he likes,
that we must look for the leaven of the Antichristian
spirit at work.</p>

<p>It is evident that this spirit will infect the
Church, and especially those in place of authority
therein; so that the elect will have to wrestle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
against both &ldquo;principalities and powers&rdquo; in the
state, and also &ldquo;spiritual wickedness in the high
places&rdquo; of the Church. Perhaps it will be this
feeling of antagonism between the inferior orders
and the highest which will throw the Bishops into
the arms of the state, and establish that unholy
alliance which will be cemented for the purpose
of oppressing all who hold the truth in sincerity,
who are definite in their dogmatic statements of
Christ&rsquo;s having been manifested in the flesh, who
labor to establish the Daily Sacrifice, and offer in
every place the pure offering spoken of by Malachi.
Perhaps it was in anticipation of this, that ancient
mystical interpreters explained the scene at the
well in Midian as having reference to the last
times.</p>

<p>The Church, like the daughters of Reuel, comes
to the Well of living waters to water her parched
flock; whereupon the shepherds&mdash;her chief pastors&mdash;arise
and strive with her. &ldquo;Fear not, O flock,
fear not, O daughter!&rdquo; exclaims the commentator;
&ldquo;thy true Moses is seated on the well, and He
will arise out of His resting-place, and will with
His own hand smite the shepherds, and water the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
flock.&rdquo; Let the sheep be in barren and dry pastures,&mdash;so
long the shepherds strive not; let the
sheep pant and die,&mdash;so long the shepherds show
no signs of irritation; but let the Church approach
the limpid well of life, and at once her prelates
will, in the latter days, combine &ldquo;to strive&rdquo; with
her, and keep back the flock from the reviving
streams.</p>

<p>In the time of Antichrist the Church will be
divided: one portion will hold to the world-power,
the other will seek out the old paths, and cling to
the only true Guide. The high places will be
filled with unbelievers in the Incarnation, and the
Church will be in a condition of the utmost spiritual
degradation, but enjoying the highest State patronage.
The religion in favor will be one of morality,
but not of dogma; and the Man of Sin will be
able to promulgate his doctrine, according to St.
Anselm, through his great eloquence and wisdom,
his vast learning and mightiness in the Holy Scriptures,
which he will wrest to the overthrowing of
dogma. He will be liberal in bribes, for he will
be of unbounded wealth; he will be capable of
performing great &ldquo;signs and wonders,&rdquo; so as &ldquo;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
deceive&mdash;the very elect;&rdquo; and at the last, he will
tear the moral veil from his countenance, and a
monster of impiety and cruelty, he will inaugurate
that awful persecution, which is to last for three
years and a half, and to excel in horror all the
persecutions that have gone before.</p>

<p>In that terrible season of confusion faith will be
all but extinguished. &ldquo;When the Son of Man
cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?&rdquo; asks
our Blessed Lord, as though expecting the answer,
No; and then, says Marchantius, the vessel of the
Church will disappear in the foam of that boiling
deep of infidelity, and be hidden in the blackness
of that storm of destruction which sweeps
over the earth. The sun shall &ldquo;be darkened, and
the moon shall not give her light, and the stars
shall fall from heaven;&rdquo; the sun of faith shall have
gone out; the moon, the Church, shall not give
her light, being turned into blood, through stress
of persecution; and the stars, the great ecclesiastical
dignitaries, shall fall into apostasy. But still the
Church will remain unwrecked, she will weather
the storm; still will she come forth &ldquo;beautiful as
the moon, terrible as an army with banners;&rdquo; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
after the lapse of those three and a half years,
Christ will descend to avenge the blood of the
saints, by destroying Antichrist and the world-power.</p>

<p>Such is a brief sketch of the scriptural doctrine
of Antichrist as held by the early and medi&aelig;val
Church. Let us now see to what myths it gave
rise among the vulgar and the imaginative. Rabanus
Maurus, in his work on the life of Antichrist,
gives a full account of the miracles he will perform;
he tells us that the Man-fiend will heal the sick,
raise the dead, restore sight to the blind, hearing
to the deaf, speech to the dumb; he will raise
storms and calm them, will remove mountains,
make trees flourish or wither at a word. He will
rebuild the temple at Jerusalem, and making the
Holy City the great capital of the world. Popular
opinion added that his vast wealth would be obtained
from hidden treasures, which are now being
concealed by the demons for his use. Various
possessed persons, when interrogated, announced
that such was the case, and that the amount of
buried gold was vast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the year 1599,&rdquo; says Canon Moreau, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
contemporary historian, &ldquo;a rumor circulated with prodigious
rapidity through Europe, that Antichrist
had been born at Babylon, and that already the
Jews of that part were hurrying to receive and
recognize him as their Messiah. The news came
from Italy and Germany, and extended to Spain,
England, and other Western kingdoms, troubling
many people, even the most discreet; however, the
learned gave it no credence, saying that the signs
predicted in Scripture to precede that event were
not yet accomplished, and among other that the
Roman empire was not yet abolished.... Others
said that, as for the signs, the majority had already
appeared to the best of their knowledge, and with
regard to the rest, they might have taken place in
distant regions without their having been made
known to them; that the Roman empire existed
but in name, and that the interpretation of the
passage on which its destruction was predicted,
might be incorrect; that for many centuries, the
most learned and pious had believed in the near
approach of Antichrist, some believing that he had
already come, on account of the persecutions which
had fallen on the Christians; others, on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
fires, or eclipses, or earthquakes.... Every one was
in excitement; some declared that the news must be
correct, others believed nothing about it, and the
agitation became so excessive, that Henry IV., who
was then on the throne, was compelled by edict to
forbid any mention of the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report spoken of by Moreau gained additional
confirmation from the announcement made by an exorcised
demoniac, that in 1600, the Man of Sin had
been born in the neighborhood of Paris, of a Jewess,
named Blanchefleure, who had conceived by Satan.
The child had been baptized at the Sabbath of Sorcerers;
and a witch, under torture, acknowledged
that she had rocked the infant Antichrist on her
knees, and she averred that he had claws on his
feet, wore no shoes, and spoke all languages.</p>

<p>In 1623 appeared the following startling announcement,
which obtained an immense circulation among
the lower orders: &ldquo;We, brothers of the Order of St.
John of Jerusalem, in the Isle of Malta, have received
letters from our spies, who are engaged in our service
in the country of Babylon, now possessed by the
Grand Turk; by the which letters we are advertised,
that, on the 1st of May, in the year of our Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
1623, a child was born in the town of Bourydot,
otherwise called Calka, near Babylon, of the which
child the mother is a very aged woman, of race
unknown, called Fort-Juda: of the father nothing is
known. The child is dusky, has pleasant mouth and
eyes, teeth pointed like those of a cat, ears large,
stature by no means exceeding that of other children;
the said child, incontinent on his birth, walked
and talked perfectly well. His speech is comprehended
by every one, admonishing the people that
he is the true Messiah, and the son of God, and that
in him all must believe. Our spies also swear and
protest that they have seen the said child with their
own eyes; and they add, that, on the occasion of his
nativity, there appeared marvellous signs in heaven,
for at full noon the sun lost its brightness, and was
for some time obscured.&rdquo; This is followed by a list
of other signs appearing, the most remarkable being
a swarm of flying serpents, and a shower of precious
stones.</p>

<p>According to Sebastian Michaeliz, in his history of
the possessed of Flanders, on the authority of the exorcised
demons, we learn that Antichrist is to be a
son of Beelzebub, who will accompany his offspring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
under the form of a bird, with four feet and a bull&rsquo;s
head; that he will torture Christians with the same
tortures with which the lost souls are racked; that
he will be able to fly, speak all languages, and will
have any number of names.</p>

<p>We find that Antichrist is known to the Mussulmans
as well as to Christians. Lane, in his edition
of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; gives some curious details
on Moslem ideas regarding him. According to
these, Antichrist will overrun the earth, mounted on
an ass, and followed by 40,000 Jews; his empire
will last forty days, whereof the first day will
be a year long, the duration of the second will
be a month, that of the third a week, the others
being of their usual length. He will devastate the
whole world, leaving Mecca and Medina alone in
security, as these holy cities will be guarded by
angelic legions. Christ at last will descend to earth,
and in a great battle will destroy the Man-devil.</p>

<p>Several writers, of different denominations, no less
superstitious than the common people, connected the
apparition of Antichrist with the fable of Pope Joan,
which obtained such general credence at one time,
but which modern criticism has at length succeeded
in excluding from history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
Perhaps the earliest writer to mention Pope Joan
is Marianus Scotus, who in his chronicle inserts the
following passage: &ldquo;A.&nbsp;D. 854, Lotharii 14, Joanna,
a woman, succeeded Leo, and reigned two years,
five months, and four days.&rdquo; Marianus Scotus died
A.&nbsp;D. 1086. Sigebert de Gemblours (d. 5th Oct.,
1112) inserts the same story in his valuable chronicle,
copying from an interpolated passage in the work
of Anastasius the librarian. His words are, &ldquo;It is
reported that this John was a female, and that she
conceived by one of her servants. The Pope, becoming
pregnant, gave birth to a child; wherefore
some do not number her among the Pontiffs.&rdquo; Hence
the story spread among the medi&aelig;val chroniclers,
who were great plagiarists. Otto of Frisingen and
Gotfrid of Viterbo mention the Lady-Pope in their
histories, and Martin Polonus gives details as follows:
&ldquo;After Leo IV., John Anglus, a native of
Metz, reigned two years, five months, and four days.
And the pontificate was vacant for a month. He died
in Rome. He is related to have been a female, and,
when a girl, to have accompanied her sweetheart in
male costume to Athens; there she advanced in various
sciences, and none could be found to equal her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
So, after having studied for three years in Rome,
she had great masters for her pupils and hearers.
And when there arose a high opinion in the city of
her virtue and knowledge, she was unanimously
elected Pope. But during her papacy she became
in the family way by a familiar. Not knowing the
time of birth, as she was on her way from St. Peter&rsquo;s
to the Lateran she had a painful delivery, between
the Coliseum and St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, in the street.
Having died after, it is said that she was buried on
the spot; and therefore the Lord Pope always turns
aside from that way, and it is supposed by some out
of detestation for what happened there. Nor on that
account is she placed in the catalogue of the Holy
Pontiffs, not only on account of her sex, but also
because of the horribleness of the circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly a story at all scandalous <i>crescit eundo</i>.</p>

<p>William Ocham alludes to the story, and John
Huss, only too happy to believe it, provides the lady
with a name, and asserts that she was baptized
Agnes, or, as he will have it with a strong aspirate,
Hagnes. Others, however, insist upon her name
having been Gilberta; and some stout Germans, not
relishing the notion of her being a daughter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
Fatherland, palm her off on England. As soon as we
arrive at Reformation times, the German and French
Protestants fasten on the story with the utmost
avidity, and add sweet little touches of their own,
and draw conclusions galling enough to the Roman
See, illustrating their accounts with wood engravings
vigorous and graphic, but hardly decent. One of
these represents the event in a peculiarly startling
manner. The procession of bishops, with the Host
and tapers, is sweeping along, when suddenly the
cross-bearer before the triple-crowned and vested
Pope starts aside to witness the unexpected arrival.
This engraving, which it is quite impossible for me
to reproduce, is in a curious little book, entitled
&ldquo;Puerperium Johannis Pap&aelig; 8, 1530.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following jingling record of the event is from
the Rhythmical Vit&aelig; Pontificum of Gulielmus Jacobus
of Egmonden, a work never printed. This
fragment is preserved in &ldquo;Wolfii Lectionum Memorabilium
centenarii, XVI.:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stephen Blanch, in his &ldquo;Urbis Rom&aelig; Mirabilia,&rdquo;
says that an angel of heaven appeared to Joan
before the event, and asked her to choose whether
she would prefer burning eternally in hell, or having
her confinement in public; with sense which
does her credit, she chose the latter. The Protestant
writers were not satisfied that the father of
the unhappy baby should have been a servant: some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
made him a Cardinal, and others the devil himself.
According to an eminent Dutch minister, it is immaterial
whether the child be fathered on Satan
or a monk; at all events, the former took a lively
interest in the youthful Antichrist, and, on the occasion
of his birth, was seen and heard fluttering
overhead, crowing and chanting in an unmusical
voice the Sibylline verses announcing the birth of
the Arch-persecutor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Papa pater patrum, Papiss&aelig; pandito partum<br /></span>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>which lines, as being perhaps the only ones known
to be of diabolic composition, are deserving of preservation.</p>

<p>The Reformers, in order to reconcile dates, were
put to the somewhat perplexing necessity of moving
Pope Joan to their own times, or else of giving to
the youthful Antichrist an age of seven hundred
years.</p>

<p>It must be allowed that the <i>accouchement</i> of a
Pope in full pontificals, during a solemn procession,
was a prodigy not likely to occur more than once
in the world&rsquo;s history, and was certain to be of
momentous import.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
It will be seen by the curious woodcut reproduced
as frontispiece from Baptista Mantuanus, that
he consigned Pope Joan to the jaws of hell, notwithstanding
her choice. The verses accompanying
this picture are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hic pendebat adhuc sexum mentita virile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">F&oelig;mina, cui triplici Phrygiam diademate mitram<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extollebat apex: et pontificalis adulter.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It need hardly be stated that the whole story of
Pope Joan is fabulous, and rests on not the slightest
historical foundation. It was probably a Greek invention
to throw discredit on the papal hierarchy,
first circulated more than two hundred years after
the date of the supposed Pope. Even Martin Polonus
(A.&nbsp;D. 1282), who is the first to give the details,
does so merely on popular report.</p>

<p>The great champions of the myth were the Protestants
of the sixteenth century, who were thoroughly
unscrupulous in distorting history and suppressing
facts, so long as they could make a point. A paper
war was waged upon the subject, and finally the
whole story was proved conclusively to be utterly
destitute of historical truth. A melancholy example
of the blindness of party feeling and prejudice is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
seen in Mosheim, who assumes the truth of the
ridiculous story, and gravely inserts it in his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical
History.&rdquo; &ldquo;Between Leo IV., who died
855, and Benedict III., a woman, who concealed
her sex and assumed the name of John, it is said,
opened her way to the Pontifical throne by her
learning and genius, and governed the Church for
a time. She is commonly called the Papess Joan.
During the five subsequent centuries the witnesses
to this extraordinary event are without number; nor
did any one, prior to the Reformation by Luther,
regard the thing as either incredible or disgraceful
to the Church.&rdquo; Such are Mosheim&rsquo;s words, and
I give them as a specimen of the credit which is
due to his opinion. The &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History&rdquo;
he wrote is full of perversions of the plainest facts,
and that under our notice is but one out of many.
&ldquo;During the five centuries after her reign,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;the witnesses to the story are innumerable.&rdquo; Now,
for two centuries there is not an allusion to be
found to the events. The only passage which can
be found is a universally acknowledged interpolation
of the &ldquo;Lives of the Popes,&rdquo; by Anastasius
Bibliothecarius; and this interpolation is stated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
the first printed edition by Bus&aelig;us, Mogunt. 1602,
to be only found in two MS. copies.</p>

<p>From Marianus Scotus or Sigebert de Gemblours
the story passed into other chronicles <i>totidem verbis</i>,
and generally with hesitation and an expression of
doubt in its accuracy. Martin Polonus is the first
to give the particulars, some four hundred and
twenty years after the reign of the fabulous Pope.</p>

<p>Mosheim is false again in asserting that no one
prior to the Reformation regarded the thing as
either incredible or disgraceful. This is but of a
piece with his malignity and disregard for truth,
whenever he can hit the Catholic Church hard.
Bart. Platina, in his &ldquo;Lives of the Popes,&rdquo; written
before Luther was born, after relating the story, says,
&ldquo;These things which I relate are popular reports,
but derived from uncertain and obscure authors,
which I have therefore inserted briefly and baldly,
lest I should seem to omit obstinately and pertinaciously
what most people assert.&rdquo; Thus the facts
were justly doubted by Platina on the legitimate
grounds that they rested on popular gossip, and not
on reliable history. Marianus Scotus, the first to
relate the story, died in 1086. He was a monk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
of St. Martin of Cologne, then of Fulda, and lastly
of St. Alban&rsquo;s, at Metz. How could he have obtained
reliable information, or seen documents upon
which to ground the assertion? Again, his chronicle
has suffered severely from interpolations in numerous
places, and there is reason to believe that
the Pope-Joan passage is itself a late interpolation.</p>

<p>If so, we are reduced to Sigebert de Gemblours
(d. 1112), placing two centuries and a half between
him and the event he records, and his chronicle
may have been tampered with.</p>

<p>The historical discrepancies are sufficiently glaring
to make the story more than questionable.</p>

<p>Leo IV. died on the 17th July, 855; and Benedict
III. was consecrated on the 1st September in the
same year; so that it is impossible to insert between
their pontificates a reign of two years, five months,
and four days. It is, however, true that there was
an antipope elected upon the death of Leo, at the
instance of the Emperor Louis; but his name was
Anastasius. This man possessed himself of the
palace of the Popes, and obtained the incarceration
of Benedict. However, his supporters almost immediately
deserted him, and Benedict assumed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
pontificate. The reign of Benedict was only for
two years and a half, so that Anastasius cannot
be the supposed Joan; nor do we hear of any
charge brought against him to the effect of his
being a woman. But the stout partisans of the
Pope-Joan tale assert, on the authority of the &ldquo;Annales
Augustani,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and some other, but late authorities,
that the female Pope was John VIII.,
who consecrated Louis II. of France, and Ethelwolf
of England. Here again is confusion. Ethelwolf
sent Alfred to Rome in 853, and the youth
received regal unction from the hands of Leo IV.
In 855 Ethelwolf visited Rome, it is true, but
was not consecrated by the existing Pope, whilst
Charles the Bald was anointed by John VIII. in
875. John VIII. was a Roman, son of Gundus,
and an archdeacon of the Eternal City. He assumed
the triple crown in 872, and reigned till
December 18, 882. John took an active part in the
troubles of the Church under the incursions of the
Sarasins, and 325 letters of his are extant, addressed
to the princes and prelates of his day.</p>

<p>Any one desirous of pursuing this examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
into the untenable nature of the story may find an
excellent summary of the arguments used on both
sides in Gieseler, &ldquo;Lehrbuch,&rdquo; &amp;c., Cunningham&rsquo;s
trans., vol. ii. pp. 20, 21, or in Bayle, &ldquo;Dictionnaire,&rdquo;
tom. iii. art. Papesse.</p>

<p>The arguments in favor of the myth may be
seen in Spanheim, &ldquo;Exercit. de Papa F&oelig;mina,&rdquo;
Opp. tom. ii. p. 577, or in Lenfant, &ldquo;Histoire de
la Papesse Jeanne,&rdquo; La Haye, 1736, 2 vols. 12mo.</p>

<p>The arguments on the other side may be had in
&ldquo;Allatii Confutatio Fabul&aelig; de Johanna Papissa,&rdquo;
Colon. 1645; in Le Quien, &ldquo;Oriens Christianus,&rdquo;
tom. iii. p. 777; and in the pages of the Lutheran
Huemann, &ldquo;Sylloge Diss. Sacras.,&rdquo; tom. i. par. ii.
p. 352.</p>

<p>The final development of this extraordinary story,
under the delicate fingers of the German and
French Protestant controversialists, may not prove
uninteresting.</p>

<p>Joan was the daughter of an English missionary,
who left England to preach the Gospel to the recently
converted Saxons. She was born at Engelheim,
and according to different authors she
was christened Agnes, Gerberta, Joanna, Margaret,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
Isabel, Dorothy, or Jutt&mdash;the last must have been
a nickname surely! She early distinguished herself
for genius and love of letters. A young monk
of Fulda having conceived for her a violent passion,
which she returned with ardor, she deserted
her parents, dressed herself in male attire, and in
the sacred precincts of Fulda divided her affections
between the youthful monk and the musty
books of the monastic library. Not satisfied with
the restraints of conventual life, nor finding the
library sufficiently well provided with books of
abstruse science, she eloped with her young man,
and after visiting England, France, and Italy, she
brought him to Athens, where she addicted herself
with unflagging devotion to her literary pursuits.
Wearied out by his journey, the monk expired in
the arms of the blue-stocking who had influenced
his life for evil, and the young lady of so many
aliases was for a while inconsolable. She left
Athens and repaired to Rome. There she opened
a school and acquired such a reputation for learning
and feigned sanctity, that, on the death of Leo
IV., she was unanimously elected Pope. For two
years and five months, under the name of John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
VIII., she filled the papal chair with reputation,
no one suspecting her sex. But having taken a
fancy to one of the cardinals, by him she became
pregnant. At length arrived the time of Rogation
processions. Whilst passing the street between the
amphitheatre and St. Clement&rsquo;s, she was seized
with violent pains, fell to the ground amidst the
crowd, and, whilst her attendants ministered to her,
was delivered of a son. Some say the child and
mother died on the spot, some that she survived
but was incarcerated, some that the child was
spirited away to be the Antichrist of the last days.
A marble monument representing the papess with
her baby was erected on the spot, which was declared
to be accursed to all ages.</p>

<p>I have little doubt myself that Pope Joan is an
impersonification of the great whore of Revelation,
seated on the seven hills, and is the popular expression
of the idea prevalent from the twelfth to
the sixteenth centuries, that the mystery of iniquity
was somehow working in the papal court. The
scandal of the Antipopes, the utter worldliness and
pride of others, the spiritual fornication with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
kings of the earth, along with the words of Revelation
prophesying the advent of an adulterous
woman who should rule over the imperial city,
and her connection with Antichrist, crystallized
into this curious myth, much as the floating uncertainty
as to the signification of our Lord&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;There be some standing here which shall not
taste of death till they see the kingdom of God,&rdquo;
condensed into the myth of the Wandering Jew.</p>

<p>The literature connected with Antichrist is voluminous.
I need only specify some of the most
curious works which have appeared on the subject.
St. Hippolytus and Rabanus Maurus have
been already alluded to. Commodianus wrote
&ldquo;Carmen Apologeticum adversus Gentes,&rdquo; which
has been published by Dom Pitra in his &ldquo;Spicilegium
Solesmense,&rdquo; with an introduction containing
Jewish and Christian traditions relating to
Antichrist. &ldquo;De Turpissima Conceptione, Nativitate,
et aliis Pr&aelig;sagiis Diaboliciis illius Turpissimi
Hominis Antichristi,&rdquo; is the title of a strange little
volume published by Lenoir in A.&nbsp;D. 1500, containing
rude yet characteristic woodcuts, representing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
the birth, life, and death of the Man of Sin,
each picture accompanied by French verses in explanation.
An equally remarkable illustrated work
on Antichrist is the famous &ldquo;Liber de Antichristo,&rdquo;
a blockbook of an early date. It is in twenty-seven
folios, and is excessively rare. Dibdin has reproduced
three of the plates in his &ldquo;Bibliotheca Spenseriana,&rdquo;
and Falckenstein has given full details of
the work in his &ldquo;Geschichte der Buchdruckerkunst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is an Easter miracle-play of the twelfth
century, still extant, the subject of which is the
&ldquo;Life and Death of Antichrist.&rdquo; More curious
still is the &ldquo;Farce de l&rsquo;Ant&eacute;christ et de Trois
Femmes&rdquo;&mdash;a composition of the sixteenth century,
when that mysterious personage occupied all
brains. The farce consists in a scene at a fish-stall,
with three good ladies quarrelling over some
fish. Antichrist steps in,&mdash;for no particular reason
that one can see,&mdash;upsets fish and fish-women, sets
them fighting, and skips off the stage. The best
book on Antichrist, and that most full of learning
and judgment, is Malvenda&rsquo;s great work in two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
folio volumes, &ldquo;De Antichristo, libri xii.&rdquo; Lyons,
1647.</p>

<p>For the fable of the Pope Joan, see J. Lenfant,
&ldquo;Histoire de la Papesse Jeanne.&rdquo; La Haye, 1736,

<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY one knows that the moon is inhabited
by a man with a bundle of sticks on his back,
who has been exiled thither for many centuries,
and who is so far off that he is beyond the reach
of death.</p>

<p>He has once visited this earth, if the nursery
rhyme is to be credited, when it asserts that&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Man in the Moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down too soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And asked his way to Norwich;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but whether he ever reached that city, the same
authority does not state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
The story as told by nurses is, that this man was
found by Moses gathering sticks on a Sabbath,
and that, for this crime, he was doomed to reside
in the moon till the end of all things; and they
refer to Numbers xv. 32-36:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And while the children of Israel were in the
wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks
upon the Sabbath day. And they that found him
gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
Aaron, and unto all the congregation. And they
put him in ward, because it was not declared what
should be done to him. And the Lord said unto
Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all
the congregation shall stone him with stones without
the camp. And all the congregation brought
him without the camp, and stoned him with stones
till he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, in the sacred writings there is no
allusion to the moon.</p>

<p>The German tale is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ages ago there went one Sunday morning an
old man into the wood to hew sticks. He cut a
fagot and slung it on a stout staff, cast it over
his shoulder, and began to trudge home with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
burden. On his way he met a handsome man
in Sunday suit, walking towards the Church; this
man stopped and asked the fagot-bearer, &ldquo;Do you
know that this is Sunday on earth, when all must
rest from their labors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunday on earth, or Monday in heaven, it is
all one to me!&rdquo; laughed the wood-cutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then bear your bundle forever,&rdquo; answered the
stranger; &ldquo;and as you value not Sunday on earth,
yours shall be a perpetual Moon-day in heaven;
and you shall stand for eternity in the moon, a
warning to all Sabbath-breakers.&rdquo; Thereupon the
stranger vanished, and the man was caught up with
his stock and his fagot into the moon, where he
stands yet.</p>

<p>The superstition seems to be old in Germany, for
the full moon is spoken of as <i>wadel</i>, or <i>wedel</i>, a
fagot. Tobler relates the story thus: &ldquo;An arma
m&#257; ket alawel am Sonnti holz ufglesa. Do hedem
der liebe Gott dwahl gloh, &ouml;b er lieber wott ider
sonn verbrenna oder im mo verfrura, do willer
lieber inn mo ihi. Dromm siedma no jetz an ma
im mo inna, wenns wedel ist. Er hed a p&uuml;scheli
uffem rogga.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> That is to say, he was given the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
choice of burning in the sun, or of freezing in the
moon; he chose the latter; and now at full moon
he is to be seen seated with his bundle of fagots
on his back.</p>

<p>In Schaumburg-Lippe,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the story goes, that a
man and a woman stand in the moon, the man
because he strewed brambles and thorns on the
church path, so as to hinder people from attending
Mass on Sunday morning; the woman because
she made butter on that day. The man carries
his bundle of thorns, the woman her butter-tub.
A similar tale is told in Swabia and in Marken.
Fischart<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> says, that there &ldquo;is to be seen in the
moon a manikin who stole wood;&rdquo; and Pr&aelig;torius,
in his description of the world,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that &ldquo;superstitious
people assert that the black flecks in the moon are
a man who gathered wood on a Sabbath, and is
therefore turned into stone.&rdquo;</p>

to the man in the moon, and attributes to him the
same idea of theft. Of Lady Cynthia, or the moon,
he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>Ritson, among his &ldquo;Ancient Songs,&rdquo; gives one
extracted from a manuscript of the time of Edward
II., on the Man in the Moon, but in very obscure

<p>Alexander Necham, or Nequam, a writer of the
twelfth century, in commenting on the dispersed
shadows in the moon, thus alludes to the vulgar
belief: &ldquo;Nonne novisti quid vulgus vocet rusticum
in luna portantem spinas? Unde quidam
vulgariter loquens ait:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">

</div>
</div>

<p>which may be translated thus: &ldquo;Do you know
what they call the rustic in the moon, who carries

<p>Shakspeare refers to the same individual in his
&ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rdquo; Quince the carpenter,
giving directions for the performance of the
play of &ldquo;Pyramus and Thisbe,&rdquo; orders: &ldquo;One must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say
he comes in to disfigure, or to present, the person
of Moonshine.&rdquo; And the enacter of this part says,
&ldquo;All I have to say is, to tell you that the lantern
is the moon; I the man in the moon; this thorn-bush
my thorn-bush; and this dog my dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also &ldquo;Tempest,&rdquo; Act 2, Scene 2:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cal.</i> Hast thou not dropt from heaven?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Steph.</i> Out o&rsquo; th&rsquo; moon, I do assure thee. I was the man
in th&rsquo; moon when time was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Cal.</i> I have seen thee in her; and I do adore thee. My
mistress showed me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The dog I have myself had pointed out to me by
an old Devonshire crone. If popular superstition
places a dog in the moon, it puts a lamb in the
sun; for in the same county it is said that those
who see the sun rise on Easter-day, may behold in
the orb the lamb and flag.</p>

<p>I believe this idea of locating animals in the two
great luminaries of heaven to be very ancient, and
to be a relic of a primeval superstition of the Aryan
race.</p>

<p>There is an ancient pictorial representation of
our friend the Sabbath-breaker in Gyffyn Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
near Conway. The roof of the chancel is divided
into compartments, in four of which are the Evangelistic
symbols, rudely, yet effectively painted. Besides
these symbols is delineated in each compartment
an orb of heaven. The sun, the moon, and
two stars, are placed at the feet of the Angel,
the Bull, the Lion, and the Eagle. The representation
of the moon is as below; in the disk is the
conventional man with his bundle of sticks, but
without the dog. There is also a curious seal appended
to a deed preserved in the Record Office,
dated the 9th year of Edward the Third (1335),
bearing the man in the moon as its device. The
deed is one of conveyance of a messuage, barn, and
four acres of ground, in the parish of Kingston-on-Thames,
from Walter de Grendesse, clerk, to Margaret
his mother. On the seal we see the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
carrying his sticks, and the moon surrounds him.
There are also a couple of stars added, perhaps to
show that he is in the sky. The legend on the
seal reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;Te Waltere docebo<br />
cur spinas phebo<br />
gero,&rdquo;</p>

<p>which may be translated, &ldquo;I will teach thee, Walter,
why I carry thorns in the moon.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The general superstition with regard to the spots
in the moon may briefly be summed up thus: A
man is located in the moon; he is a thief or Sabbath-breaker;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
he has a pole over his shoulder, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
which is suspended a bundle of sticks or thorns. In
some places a woman is believed to accompany him,
and she has a butter-tub with her; in other localities
she is replaced by a dog.</p>

<p>The belief in the Moon-man seems to exist among
the natives of British Columbia; for I read in one
of Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s letters to the Church Missionary
Society, &ldquo;One very dark night I was told that there
was a moon to see on the beach. On going to see,
there was an illuminated disk, with the figure of a
man upon it. The water was then very low, and
one of the conjuring parties had lit up this disk at
the water&rsquo;s edge. They had made it of wax, with
great exactness, and presently it was at full. It was
an imposing sight. Nothing could be seen around
it; but the Indians suppose that the medicine party
are then holding converse with the man in the
moon.... After a short time the moon waned away,
and the conjuring party returned whooping to their
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now let us turn to Scandinavian mythology, and
see what we learn from that source.</p>

<p>M&acirc;ni, the moon, stole two children from their
parents, and carried them up to heaven. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
names were Hjuki and Bil. They had been drawing
water from the well Byrgir, in the bucket S&oelig;gr,
suspended from the pole Simul, which they bore
upon their shoulders. These children, pole, and
bucket were placed in heaven, &ldquo;where they could
be seen from earth.&rdquo; This refers undoubtedly to
the spots in the moon; and so the Swedish peasantry
explain these spots to this day, as representing
a boy and a girl bearing a pail of water between
them. Are we not reminded at once of our nursery
rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Jack and Jill went up a hill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To fetch a pail of water;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jack fell down, and broke his crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Jill came tumbling after&rdquo;?<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This verse, which to us seems at first sight nonsense,
I have no hesitation in saying has a high
antiquity, and refers to the Eddaic Hjuki and Bil.
The names indicate as much. Hjuki, in Norse,
would be pronounced Juki, which would readily
become Jack; and Bil, for the sake of euphony, and
in order to give a female name to one of the children,
would become Jill.</p>

<p>The fall of Jack, and the subsequent fall of Jill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
simply represent the vanishing of one moon-spot
after another, as the moon wanes.</p>

<p>But the old Norse myth had a deeper signification
than merely an explanation of the moon-spots.</p>

<p>Hjuki is derived from the verb jakka, to heap or
pile together, to assemble and increase; and Bil
from bila, to break up or dissolve. Hjuki and Bil,
therefore, signify nothing more than the waxing and
waning of the moon, and the water they are represented
as bearing signifies the fact that the rainfall
depends on the phases of the moon. Waxing and
waning were individualized, and the meteorological
fact of the connection of the rain with the moon was
represented by the children as water-bearers.</p>

<p>But though Jack and Jill became by degrees dissevered
in the popular mind from the moon, the
original myth went through a fresh phase, and exists
still under a new form. The Norse superstition
attributed <em>theft</em> to the moon, and the vulgar soon
began to believe that the figure they saw in the moon
was the thief. The lunar specks certainly may be
made to resemble one figure, and only a lively imagination
can discern two. The girl soon dropped
out of popular mythology, the boy oldened into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
venerable man, he retained his pole, and the bucket
was transformed into the thing he had stolen&mdash;sticks
or vegetables. The theft was in some places
exchanged for Sabbath-breaking, especially among
those in Protestant countries who were acquainted
with the Bible story of the stick-gatherer.</p>

<p>The Indian superstition is worth examining, because
of the connection existing between Indian and
European mythology, on account of our belonging
to the same Aryan stock.</p>

<p>According to a Buddhist legend, S&acirc;kyamunni himself,
in one of his earlier stages of existence, was a
hare, and lived in friendship with a fox and an ape.
In order to test the virtue of the Bodhisattwa, Indra
came to the friends, in the form of an old man, asking
for food. Hare, ape, and fox went forth in quest
of victuals for their guest. The two latter returned
from their foraging expedition successful, but the
hare had found nothing. Then, rather than that he
should treat the old man with inhospitality, the hare
had a fire kindled, and cast himself into the flames,
that he might himself become food for his guest.
In reward for this act of self-sacrifice, Indra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
carried the hare to heaven, and placed him in the
moon.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Here we have an old man and a hare in connection
with the lunar planet, just as in Shakspeare we
have a fagot-bearer and a dog.</p>

<p>The fable rests upon the name of the moon in
Sanskrit, &ccedil;a&ccedil;in, or &ldquo;that marked with the hare;&rdquo;
but whether the belief in the spots taking the shape
of a hare gave the name &ccedil;a&ccedil;in to the moon, or the
lunar name &ccedil;a&ccedil;in originated the belief, it is impossible
for us to say.</p>

<p>Grounded upon this myth is the curious story of
&ldquo;The Hare and the Elephant,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Pantschatantra,&rdquo;
an ancient collection of Sanskrit fables. It
will be found as the first tale in the third book. I
have room only for an outline of the story.</p>


<h3>THE CRAFTY HARE.</h3>

<p>In a certain forest lived a mighty elephant, king
of a herd, Toothy by name. On a certain occasion
there was a long drought, so that pools, tanks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
swamps, and lakes were dried up. Then the elephants
sent out exploring parties in search of water.
A young one discovered an extensive lake surrounded
with trees, and teeming with water-fowl. It went
by the name of the Moon-lake. The elephants, delighted
at the prospect of having an inexhaustible
supply of water, marched off to the spot, and found
their most sanguine hopes realized. Round about
the lake, in the sandy soil, were innumerable hare
warrens; and as the herd of elephants trampled on
the ground, the hares were severely injured, their
homes broken down, their heads, legs, and backs
crushed beneath the ponderous feet of the monsters
of the forest. As soon as the herd had withdrawn,
the hares assembled, some halting, some dripping
with blood, some bearing the corpses of their cherished
infants, some with piteous tales of ruination
in their houses, all with tears streaming from their
eyes, and wailing forth, &ldquo;Alas, we are lost! The
elephant-herd will return, for there is no water elsewhere,
and that will be the death of all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the wise and prudent Longear volunteered
to drive the herd away; and he succeeded in this
manner: Longear went to the elephants, and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
singled out their king, he addressed him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! bad elephant! what brings you with
such thoughtless frivolity to this strange lake? Back
with you at once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the king of the elephants heard this, he
asked in astonishment, &ldquo;Pray, who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied Longear,&mdash;&ldquo;I am Vidschajadatta by
name; the hare who resides in the Moon. Now
am I sent by his Excellency the Moon as an ambassador
to you. I speak to you in the name of the
Moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! Hare,&rdquo; said the elephant, somewhat staggered;
&ldquo;and what message have you brought me
from his Excellency the Moon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have this day injured several hares. Are
you not aware that they are the subjects of me?
If you value your life, venture not near the lake
again. Break my command, and I shall withdraw
my beams from you at night, and your bodies will
be consumed with perpetual sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elephant, after a short meditation, said,
&ldquo;Friend! it is true that I have acted against the
rights of the excellent Majesty of the Moon. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
should wish to make an apology; how can I do
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hare replied, &ldquo;Come along with me, and I
will show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elephant asked, &ldquo;Where is his Excellency at
present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other replied, &ldquo;He is now in the lake, hearing
the complaints of the maimed hares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo; said the elephant, humbly,
&ldquo;bring me to my lord, that I may tender him my
submission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the hare conducted the king of the elephants
to the edge of the lake, and showed him the reflection
of the moon in the water, saying, &ldquo;There
stands our lord in the midst of the water, plunged
in meditation; reverence him with devotion, and
then depart with speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the elephant poked his proboscis into
the water, and muttered a fervent prayer. By so
doing he set the water in agitation, so that the reflection
of the moon was all of a quiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed the hare; &ldquo;his Majesty is
trembling with rage at you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is his supreme Excellency enraged with
me?&rdquo; asked the elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
&ldquo;Because you have set the water in motion.
Worship him, and then be off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elephant let his ears droop, bowed his great
head to the earth, and after having expressed in
suitable terms his regret for having annoyed the
Moon, and the hare dwelling in it, he vowed never
to trouble the Moon-lake again. Then he departed,
and the hares have ever since lived there unmolested.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>The Mountain of Venus.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>AGGED, bald, and desolate, as though a curse
rested upon it, rises the H&ouml;rselberg out of the
rich and populous land between Eisenach and Gotha,
looking, from a distance, like a huge stone sarcophagus&mdash;a
sarcophagus in which rests in magical
slumber, till the end of all things, a mysterious world
of wonders.</p>

<p>High up on the north-west flank of the mountain,
in a precipitous wall of rock, opens a cavern, called
the H&ouml;rselloch, from the depths of which issues a
muffled roar of water, as though a subterraneous
stream were rushing over rapidly-whirling millwheels.
&ldquo;When I have stood alone on the ridge
of the mountain,&rdquo; says Bechstein, &ldquo;after having
sought the chasm in vain, I have heard a mighty
rush, like that of falling water, beneath my feet, and
after scrambling down the scarp, have found myself&mdash;how,
I never knew&mdash;in front of the cave.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Sagenschatz
des Th&uuml;ringes-landes,&rdquo; 1835.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
In ancient days, according to the Th&uuml;ringian
Chronicles, bitter cries and long-drawn moans were
heard issuing from this cavern; and at night, wild
shrieks and the burst of diabolical laughter would
ring from it over the vale, and fill the inhabitants
with terror. It was supposed that this hole gave
admittance to Purgatory; and the popular but faulty
derivation of H&ouml;rsel was <i>H&ouml;re, die Seele</i>&mdash;Hark, the
Souls!</p>

<p>But another popular belief respecting this mountain
was, that in it Venus, the pagan Goddess of
Love, held her court, in all the pomp and revelry
of heathendom; and there were not a few who declared
that they had seen fair forms of female beauty
beckoning them from the mouth of the chasm, and
that they had heard dulcet strains of music well
up from the abyss above the thunder of the falling,
unseen torrent. Charmed by the music, and allured
by the spectral forms, various individuals had entered
the cave, and none had returned, except the
Tanh&auml;user, of whom more anon. Still does the
H&ouml;rselberg go by the name of the Venusberg, a
name frequently used in the middle ages, but without
its locality being defined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;In 1398, at midday, there appeared suddenly
three great fires in the air, which presently ran
together into one globe of flame, parted again, and
finally sank into the H&ouml;rselberg,&rdquo; says the Th&uuml;ringian
Chronicle.</p>

<p>And now for the story of Tanh&auml;user.</p>

<p>A French knight was riding over the beauteous
meadows in the H&ouml;rsel vale on his way to Wartburg,
where the Landgrave Hermann was holding
a gathering of minstrels, who were to contend in
song for a prize.</p>

<p>Tanh&auml;user was a famous minnesinger, and all
his lays were of love and of women, for his heart
was full of passion, and that not of the purest and
noblest description.</p>

<p>It was towards dusk that he passed the cliff in
which is the H&ouml;rselloch, and as he rode by, he saw
a white glimmering figure of matchless beauty standing
before him, and beckoning him to her. He knew
her at once, by her attributes and by her superhuman
perfection, to be none other than Venus. As she
spake to him, the sweetest strains of music floated
in the air, a soft roseate light glowed around her,
and nymphs of exquisite loveliness scattered roses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
at her feet. A thrill of passion ran through the
veins of the minnesinger; and, leaving his horse,
he followed the apparition. It led him up the
mountain to the cave, and as it went flowers
bloomed upon the soil, and a radiant track was
left for Tanh&auml;user to follow. He entered the cavern,
and descended to the palace of Venus in the heart
of the mountain.</p>

<p>Seven years of revelry and debauch were passed,
and the minstrel&rsquo;s heart began to feel a strange
void. The beauty, the magnificence, the variety of
the scenes in the pagan goddess&rsquo;s home, and all
its heathenish pleasures, palled upon him, and he
yearned for the pure fresh breezes of earth, one
look up at the dark night sky spangled with stars,
one glimpse of simple mountain-flowers, one tinkle
of sheep-bells. At the same time his conscience
began to reproach him, and he longed to make his
peace with God. In vain did he entreat Venus to
permit him to depart, and it was only when, in the
bitterness of his grief, he called upon the Virgin-Mother,
that a rift in the mountain-side appeared
to him, and he stood again above ground.</p>

<p>How sweet was the morning air, balmy with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
scent of hay, as it rolled up the mountain to him,
and fanned his haggard cheek! How delightful to
him was the cushion of moss and scanty grass after
the downy couches of the palace of revelry below!
He plucked the little heather-bells, and held them
before him; the tears rolled from his eyes, and
moistened his thin and wasted hands. He looked
up at the soft blue sky and the newly-risen sun,
and his heart overflowed. What were the golden,
jewel-incrusted, lamp-lit vaults beneath to that pure
dome of God&rsquo;s building!</p>

<p>The chime of a village church struck sweetly on
his ear, satiated with Bacchanalian songs; and he
hurried down the mountain to the church which
called him. There he made his confession; but the
priest, horror-struck at his recital, dared not give
him absolution, but passed him on to another. And
so he went from one to another, till at last he was
referred to the Pope himself. To the Pope he went.
Urban IV. then occupied the chair of St. Peter.
To him Tanh&auml;user related the sickening story of
his guilt, and prayed for absolution. Urban was a
hard and stern man, and shocked at the immensity
of the sin, he thrust the penitent indignantly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
him, exclaiming, &ldquo;Guilt such as thine can never,
never be remitted. Sooner shall this staff in my
hand grow green and blossom, than that God should
pardon thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tanh&auml;user, full of despair, and with his
soul darkened, went away, and returned to the only
asylum open to him, the Venusberg. But lo! three
days after he had gone, Urban discovered that his
pastoral staff had put forth buds, and had burst
into flower. Then he sent messengers after Tanh&auml;user,
and they reached the H&ouml;rsel vale to hear
that a wayworn man, with haggard brow and bowed
head, had just entered the H&ouml;rselloch. Since then
Tanh&auml;user has not been seen.</p>

<p>Such is the sad yet beautiful story of Tanh&auml;user.
It is a very ancient myth Christianized, a wide-spread
tradition localized. Originally heathen, it has been
transformed, and has acquired new beauty by an
infusion of Christianity. Scattered over Europe, it
exists in various forms, but in none so graceful as
that attached to the H&ouml;rselberg. There are, however,
other Venusbergs in Germany; as, for instance,
in Swabia, near Waldsee; another near Ufhausen,
at no great distance from Freiburg (the same story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
is told of this Venusberg as of the H&ouml;rselberg); in
Saxony there is a Venusberg not far from Wolkenstein.
Paracelsus speaks of a Venusberg in Italy,
referring to that in which &AElig;neas Sylvius (Ep. 16)
says Venus or a Sibyl resides, occupying a cavern,
and assuming once a week the form of a serpent.
Geiler v. Keysersperg, a quaint old preacher of the
fifteenth century, speaks of the witches assembling
on the Venusberg.</p>

<p>The story, either in prose or verse, has often been
printed. Some of the earliest editions are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Das Lied von dem Danhewser.&rdquo; N&uuml;rnberg,
without date; the same, N&uuml;rnberg, 1515.&mdash;&ldquo;Das
Lyedt v.&nbsp;d. Thanheuser.&rdquo; Leyptzk, 1520.&mdash;&ldquo;Das
Lied v.&nbsp;d. Danhe&uuml;ser,&rdquo; reprinted by Bechstein, 1835.&mdash;&ldquo;Das
Lied vom edlen Tanheuser, Mons Veneris.&rdquo;
Frankfort, 1614; Leipzig, 1668.&mdash;&ldquo;Twe lede volgen
Dat erste vain Danh&uuml;sser.&rdquo; Without date.&mdash;&ldquo;Van
heer Danielken.&rdquo; Tantwerpen, 1544.&mdash;A Danish
version in &ldquo;Nyerup, Danske Viser,&rdquo; No. VIII.</p>

<p>Let us now see some of the forms which this
remarkable myth assumed in other countries. Every
popular tale has its root, a root which may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
traced among different countries, and though the
accidents of the story may vary, yet the substance
remains unaltered. It has been said that the common
people never invent new story-radicals any more
than we invent new word-roots; and this is perfectly
true. The same story-root remains, but it is varied
according to the temperament of the narrator or the
exigencies of localization. The story-root of the
Venusberg is this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The underground folk seek union with human
beings.</p>

<div class="padleft">
<p><ins class="greek" title="letter alpha">&#945;</ins>. A man is enticed into their abode, where he
unites with a woman of the underground
race.</p>

<p><ins class="greek" title="letter beta">&#946;</ins>. He desires to revisit the earth, and escapes.</p>

<p><ins class="greek" title="letter gamma">&#947;</ins>. He returns again to the region below.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, there is scarcely a collection of folk-lore
which does not contain a story founded on this
root. It appears in every branch of the Aryan
family, and examples might be quoted from Modern
Greek, Albanian, Neapolitan, French, German,
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, Icelandic, Scotch,
Welsh, and other collections of popular tales. I
have only space to mention some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
There is a Norse Th&aacute;ttr of a certain Helgi Thorir&rsquo;s
son, which is, in its present form, a production of
the fourteenth century. Helgi and his brother Thorstein
went on a cruise to Finnmark, or Lapland. They
reached a ness, and found the land covered with
forest. Helgi explored this forest, and lighted suddenly
on a party of red-dressed women riding upon
red horses. These ladies were beautiful and of troll
race. One surpassed the others in beauty, and she
was their mistress. They erected a tent and prepared
a feast. Helgi observed that all their vessels
were of silver and gold. The lady, who named herself
Ingibjorg, advanced towards the Norseman, and
invited him to live with her. He feasted and lived
with the trolls for three days, and then returned to
his ship, bringing with him two chests of silver
and gold, which Ingibjorg had given him. He had
been forbidden to mention where he had been and
with whom; so he told no one whence he had obtained
the chests. The ships sailed, and he returned
home.</p>

<p>One winter&rsquo;s night Helgi was fetched away from
home, in the midst of a furious storm, by two mysterious
horsemen, and no one was able to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
for many years what had become of him, till the
prayers of the king, Olaf, obtained his release, and
then he was restored to his father and brother, but
he was thenceforth blind. All the time of his absence
he had been with the red-vested lady in her
mysterious abode of Gl&oelig;sisvellir.</p>

<p>The Scotch story of Thomas of Ercildoune is the
same story. Thomas met with a strange lady, of
elfin race, beneath Eildon Tree, who led him into
the underground land, where he remained with her
for seven years. He then returned to earth, still,
however, remaining bound to come to his royal mistress
whenever she should summon him. Accordingly,
while Thomas was making merry with his
friends in the Tower of Ercildoune, a person came
running in, and told, with marks of fear and astonishment,
that a hart and a hind had left the neighboring
forest, and were parading the street of the
village. Thomas instantly arose, left his house, and
followed the animals into the forest, from which he
never returned. According to popular belief, he
still &ldquo;drees his weird&rdquo; in Fairy Land, and is one
day expected to revisit earth. (Scott, &ldquo;Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border.&rdquo;) Compare with this the
ancient ballad of Tamlane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
Debes relates that &ldquo;it happened a good while
since, when the burghers of Bergen had the commerce
of the Faroe Isles, that there was a man in
Serraade, called Jonas Soideman, who was kept by
the spirits in a mountain during the space of seven
years, and at length came out, but lived afterwards
in great distress and fear, lest they should again take
him away; wherefore people were obliged to watch
him in the night.&rdquo; The same author mentions
another young man who had been carried away,
and after his return was removed a second time,
upon the eve of his marriage.</p>

<p>Gervase of Tilbury says that &ldquo;in Catalonia there
is a lofty mountain, named Cavagum, at the foot
of which runs a river with golden sands, in the
vicinity of which there are likewise silver mines.
This mountain is steep, and almost inaccessible.
On its top, which is always covered with ice and
snow, is a black and bottomless lake, into which if
a stone be cast, a tempest suddenly arises; and near
this lake is the portal of the palace of demons.&rdquo; He
then tells how a young damsel was spirited in
there, and spent seven years with the mountain
spirits. On her return to earth she was thin and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
withered, with wandering eyes, and almost bereft
of understanding.</p>

<p>A Swedish story is to this effect. A young man
was on his way to his bride, when he was allured
into a mountain by a beautiful elfin woman. With
her he lived forty years, which passed as an hour;
on his return to earth all his old friends and relations
were dead, or had forgotten him, and finding
no rest there, he returned to his mountain elf-land.</p>

<p>In Pomerania, a laborer&rsquo;s son, Jacob Dietrich of
Rambin, was enticed away in the same manner.</p>

<p>There is a curious story told by Fordun in his
&ldquo;Scotichronicon,&rdquo; which has some interest in connection
with the legend of the Tanh&auml;user. He relates
that in the year 1050, a youth of noble birth
had been married in Rome, and during the nuptial
feast, being engaged in a game of ball, he took off
his wedding-ring, and placed it on the finger of a
statue of Venus. When he wished to resume it, he
found that the stony hand had become clinched, so
that it was impossible to remove the ring. Thenceforth
he was haunted by the Goddess Venus, who
constantly whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Embrace me; I
am Venus, whom you have wedded; I will never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
restore your ring.&rdquo; However, by the assistance of
a priest, she was at length forced to give it up to
its rightful owner.</p>

<p>The classic legend of Ulysses, held captive for
eight years by the nymph Calypso in the Island of
Ogygia, and again for one year by the enchantress
Circe, contains the root of the same story of the
Tanh&auml;user.</p>

<p>What may have been the significance of the primeval
story-radical it is impossible for us now to
ascertain; but the legend, as it shaped itself in the
middle ages, is certainly indicative of the struggle
between the new and the old faith.</p>

<p>We see thinly veiled in Tanh&auml;user the story of
a man, Christian in name, but heathen at heart,
allured by the attractions of paganism, which seems
to satisfy his poetic instincts, and which gives full
rein to his passions. But these excesses pall on him
after a while, and the religion of sensuality leaves
a great void in his breast.</p>

<p>He turns to Christianity, and at first it seems to
promise all that he requires. But alas! he is repelled
by its ministers. On all sides he is met by practice
widely at variance with profession. Pride, worldliness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
want of sympathy exist among those who should
be the foremost to guide, sustain, and receive him.
All the warm springs which gushed up in his broken
heart are choked, his softened spirit is hardened
again, and he returns in despair to bury his sorrows
and drown his anxieties in the debauchery of his
former creed.</p>

<p>A sad picture, but doubtless one very true.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>Fatality of Numbers.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE laws governing numbers are so perplexing
to the uncultivated mind, and the results arrived
at by calculation are so astonishing, that it
cannot be matter of surprise if superstition has attached
itself to numbers.</p>

<p>But even to those who are instructed in numeration,
there is much that is mysterious and unaccountable,
much that only an advanced mathematician
can explain to his own satisfaction. The
neophyte sees the numbers obedient to certain laws;
but <em>why</em> they obey these laws he cannot understand;
and the fact of his not being able so to do, tends to
give to numbers an atmosphere of mystery which
impresses him with awe.</p>

<p>For instance, the property of the number 9, discovered,
I believe, by W. Green, who died in 1794,
is inexplicable to any one but a mathematician. The
property to which I allude is this, that when 9 is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
multiplied by 2, by 3, by 4, by 5, by 6, &amp;c., it will be
found that the digits composing the product, when
added together, give 9. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Table showing property of the number 9">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">2 &times; 9 = 18,</td>

    <td class="tdc">&ldquo;</td>
    <td class="tdrt">9 + 0 = 9</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>It will be noticed that 9 &times; 11 makes 99, the sum
of the digits of which is 18 and not 9, but the sum
of the digits 1 &times; 8 equals 9.</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Table further showing property of the number 9">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrt">9 &times; 12 = 108,</td>
    <td class="tdc">and</td>
    <td class="tdrt">1 + 0 + 8 = 9</td>

    <td class="tdc">&ldquo;</td>
    <td class="tdrt">1 + 2 + 6 = 9</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>And so on to any extent.</p>

<p>M. de Maivan discovered another singular property
of the same number. If the order of the digits expressing
a number be changed, and this number be
subtracted from the former, the remainder will be 9
or a multiple of 9, and, being a multiple, the sum of
its digits will be 9.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
For instance, take the number 21, reverse the
digits, and you have 12; subtract 12 from 21, and
the remainder is 9. Take 63, reverse the digits, and
subtract 36 from 63; you have 27, a multiple of 9,
and 2 + 7 = 9. Once more, the number 13 is the
reverse of 31; the difference between these numbers
is 18, or twice 9.</p>

<p>Again, the same property found in two numbers
thus changed, is discovered in the same numbers
raised to any power.</p>

<p>Take 21 and 12 again. The square of 21 is 441,
and the square of 12 is 144; subtract 144 from 441,
and the remainder is 297, a multiple of 9; besides,
the digits expressing these powers added together
give 9. The cube of 21 is 9261, and that of 12 is
1728; their difference is 7533, also a multiple of 9.</p>

<p>The number 37 has also somewhat remarkable
properties; when multiplied by 3 or a multiple of
3 up to 27, it gives in the product three digits exactly
similar. From the knowledge of this the multiplication
of 37 is greatly facilitated, the method to
be adopted being to multiply merely the first cipher
of the multiplicand by the first multiplier; it is then
unnecessary to proceed with the multiplication, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
being sufficient to write twice to the right hand the
cipher obtained, so that the same digit will stand
in the unit, tens, and hundreds places.</p>

<p>For instance, take the results of the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered">

<p>The singular property of numbers the most different,
when added, to produce the same sum, originated
the use of magical squares for talismans.
Although the reason may be accounted for mathematically,
yet numerous authors have written concerning
them, as though there were something
&ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; about them. But the most remarkable
and exhaustive treatise on the subject is that by a
mathematician of Dijon, which is entitled &ldquo;Trait&eacute;

<p>But the connection of certain numbers with the
dogmas of religion was sufficient, besides their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
marvellous properties, to make superstition attach itself
to them. Because there were thirteen at the table
when the Last Supper was celebrated, and one of
the number betrayed his Master, and then hung
himself, it is looked upon through Christendom as
unlucky to sit down thirteen at table, the consequence
being that one of the number will die before the year
is out. &ldquo;When I see,&rdquo; said Vouvenargues, &ldquo;men
of genius not daring to sit down thirteen at table,
there is no error, ancient or modern, which astonishes
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nine, having been consecrated by Buddhism, is
regarded with great veneration by the Moguls and
Chinese: the latter bow nine times on entering the
presence of their Emperor.</p>

<p>Three is sacred among Brahminical and Christian
people, because of the Trinity of the Godhead.</p>

<p>Pythagoras taught that each number had its own
peculiar character, virtue, and properties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The unit, or the monad,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the principle
and the end of all; it is this sublime knot
which binds together the chain of causes; it is the
symbol of identity, of equality, of existence, of conservation,
and of general harmony. Having no parts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
the monad represents Divinity; it announces also
order, peace, and tranquillity, which are founded
on unity of sentiments; consequently <span class="smcap">One</span> is a
good principle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number <span class="smcap">Two</span>, or the dyad, the origin of
contrasts, is the symbol of diversity, or inequality,
of division and of separation. <span class="smcap">Two</span> is accordingly
an evil principle, a number of bad augury, characterizing
disorder, confusion, and change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Three</span>, or the triad, is the first of unequals; it
is the number containing the most sublime mysteries,
for everything is composed of three substances;
it represents God, the soul of the world,
the spirit of man.&rdquo; This number, which plays so
great a part in the traditions of Asia, and in the
Platonic philosophy, is the image of the attributes
of God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Four</span>, or the tetrad, as the first mathematical
power, is also one of the chief elements; it represents
the generating virtue, whence come all combinations;
it is the most perfect of numbers; it is
the root of all things. It is holy by nature, since
it constitutes the Divine essence, by recalling His
unity, His power, His goodness, and His wisdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
the four perfections which especially characterize
God. Consequently, Pythagoricians swear by the
quaternary number, which gives the human soul
its eternal nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number <span class="smcap">Five</span>, or the pentad, has a peculiar
force in sacred expiations; it is everything;
it stops the power of poisons, and is redoubted by
evil spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number <span class="smcap">Six</span>, or the hexad, is a fortunate
number, and it derives its merit from the first
sculptors having divided the face into six portions;
but, according to the Chaldeans, the reason is, because
God created the world in six days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Seven</span>, or the heptad, is a number very powerful
for good or for evil. It belongs especially to
sacred things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number <span class="smcap">Eight</span>, or the octad, is the first
cube, that is to say, squared in all senses, as a die,
proceeding from its base two, an even number; so
is man four-square, or perfect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The number <span class="smcap">Nine</span>, or the ennead, being the
multiple of three, should be regarded as sacred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, <span class="smcap">Ten</span>, or the decad, is the measure of
all, since it contains all the numeric relations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
harmonies. As the reunion of the four first numbers,
it plays an eminent part, since all the branches
of science, all nomenclatures, emanate from, and
retire into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary for me here to do more
than mention the peculiar character given to different
numbers by Christianity. One is the numeral
indicating the Unity of the Godhead; Two points
to the hypostatic union; Three to the Blessed Trinity;
Four to the Evangelists; Five to the Sacred
Wounds; Six is the number of sin; Seven that of
the gifts of the Spirit; Eight, that of the Beatitudes;
Ten is the number of the commandments;
Eleven speaks of the Apostles after the
loss of Judas; Twelve, of the complete apostolic
college.</p>

<p>I shall now point out certain numbers which
have been regarded with superstition, and certain
events connected with numbers which are of curious
interest.</p>

<p>The number 14 has often been observed as
having singularly influenced the life of Henry IV.
and other French princes. Let us take the history
of Henry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
On the 14th May, 1029, the first king of France
named Henry was consecrated, and on the 14th
May, 1610, the last Henry was assassinated.</p>

<p>Fourteen letters enter into the composition of the
name of Henri de Bourbon, who was the 14th
king bearing the titles of France and Navarre.</p>

<p>The 14th December, 1553, that is, 14 centuries,
14 decades, and 14 years after the birth of Christ,
Henry IV. was born; the ciphers of the date 1553,
when added together, giving the number 14.</p>

<p>The 14th May, 1554, Henry II. ordered the
enlargement of the Rue de la Ferronnerie. The
circumstance of this order not having been carried
out, occasioned the murder of Henry IV. in that
street, four times 14 years after.</p>

<p>The 14th May, 1552, was the date of the birth
of Margu&eacute;rite de Valois, first wife of Henry IV.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1588, the Parisians revolted
against Henry III., at the instigation of the Duke
of Guise.</p>

<p>On the 14th March, 1590, Henry IV. gained the
battle of Ivry.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1590, Henry was repulsed
from the Fauxbourgs of Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
On the 14th November, 1590, the Sixteen took
oath to die rather than serve Henry.</p>

<p>On the 14th November, 1592, the Parliament
registered the Papal Bull giving power to the
legate to nominate a king to the exclusion of
Henry.</p>

<p>On the 14th December, 1599, the Duke of Savoy
was reconciled to Henry IV.</p>

<p>On the 14th September, 1606, the Dauphin, afterwards
Louis XIII., was baptized.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1610, the king was stopped
in the Rue de la Ferronnerie, by his carriage becoming
locked with a cart, on account of the narrowness
of the street. Ravaillac took advantage
of the occasion for stabbing him.</p>

<p>Henry IV. lived four times 14 years, 14 weeks,
and four times 14 days; that is to say, 56 years
and 5 months.</p>

<p>On the 14th May, 1643, died Louis XIII., son
of Henry IV.; not only on the same day of the
same month as his father, but the date, 1643, when
its ciphers are added together, gives the number
14, just as the ciphers of the date of the birth of
his father gave 14.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
Louis XIV. mounted the throne in 1643: 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 14.</p>

<p>He died in the year 1715: 1 + 7 + 1 + 5 = 14.</p>

<p>He lived 77 years, and 7 + 7 = 14.</p>

<p>Louis XV. mounted the throne in the same
year; he died in 1774, which also bears the stamp
of 14, the extremes being 14, and the sum of the
means 7 + 7 making 14.</p>

<p>Louis XVI. had reigned 14 years when he convoked
the States General, which was to bring
about the Revolution.</p>

<p>The number of years between the assassination
of Henry IV. and the dethronement of Louis XVI.
is divisible by 14.</p>

<p>Louis XVII. died in 1794; the extreme digits
of the date are 14, and the first two give his
number.</p>

<p>The restoration of the Bourbons took place in
1814, also marked by the extremes being 14; also
by the sum of the ciphers making 14.</p>

<p>The following are other curious calculations made
respecting certain French kings.</p>

<p>Add the ciphers composing the year of the birth
or of the death of some of the kings of the third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
race, and the result of each sum is the titular number
of each prince. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Louis IX. was born in 1215; add the four
ciphers of this date, and you have IX.</p>

<p>Charles VII. was born in 1402; the sum of
1 + 4 + 2 gives VII.</p>

<p>Louis XII. was born in 1461; and 1 + 4 + 6 + 1
= XII.</p>

<p>Henry IV. died in 1610; and 1 + 6 + 1 = twice
IV.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. was crowned in 1643; and these
four ciphers give XIV. The same king died in
1715; and this date gives also XIV. He was aged
77 years, and again 7 + 7 = 14.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII. was born in 1755; add the digits,
and you have XVIII.</p>

<p>What is remarkable is, that this number 18 is
double the number of the king to whom the law
first applies, and is triple the number of the kings
to whom it has applied.</p>

<p>Here is another curious calculation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Robespierre fell in 1794;</p>

<p>Napoleon in 1815, and Charles X. in 1830.</p>

<p>Now, the remarkable fact in connection with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
these dates is, that the sum of the digits composing
them, added to the dates, gives the date of
the fall of the successor. Robespierre fell in 1794;
1 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 21, 1794 + 21 = 1815, the date of
the fall of Napoleon; 1 + 8 + 1 + 5 = 15, and
1815 + 15 = 1830, the date of the fall of Charles X.</p>

<p>There is a singular rule which has been supposed
to determine the length of the reigning
Pope&rsquo;s life, in the earlier half of a century. Add
his number to that of his predecessor, to that add
ten, and the result gives the year of his death.</p>

<p>Pius VII. succeeded Pius VI.; 6 + 7 = 13; add
10, and the sum is 23. Pius VII. died in 1823.</p>

<p>Leo XII. succeeded Pius VII.; 12 + 7 + 10 = 29;
and Leo XII. died in 1829.</p>

<p>Pius VIII. succeeded Leo XII.; 8 + 12 + 10 = 30;
and Pius VIII. died in 1830.</p>

<p>However, this calculation does not always apply.</p>

<p>Gregory XVI. ought to have died in 1834, but
he did not actually vacate his see till 1846.</p>

<p>It is also well known that an ancient tradition
forbids the hope of any of St. Peter&rsquo;s successors,
<i>pervenire ad annos Petri</i>; i.&nbsp;e., to reign 25
years.</p>

<p>There is one numerical curiosity of a very remarkable
character, which I must not omit.</p>

<p>The ancient Chamber of Deputies, such as it
existed in 1830, was composed of 402 members,
and was divided into two parties. The one, numbering
221 members, declared itself strongly for the
revolution of July; the other party, numbering 181,
did not favor a change. The result was the constitutional
monarchy, which re-established order
after the three memorable days of July. The
parties were known by the following nicknames.
The larger was commonly called <i>La queue de
Robespierre</i>, and the smaller, <i>Les honn&ecirc;tes gens</i>.
Now, the remarkable fact is, that if we give to the
letters of the alphabet their numerical values as
they stand in their order, as 1 for A, 2 for B, 3
for C, and so on to Z, which is valued at 25, and
then write vertically on the left hand the words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
<i>La queue de Robespierre</i>, with the number equivalent
to each letter opposite to it, and on the right
hand, in like manner, <i>Les honn&ecirc;tes gens</i>, if each
column of numbers be summed up, the result is
the number of members who formed each party.</p>

Some coincidences of dates are very remarkable.</p>

<p>On the 25th August, 1569, the Calvinists massacred
the Catholic nobles and priests at B&eacute;arn
and Navarre.</p>

<p>On the same day of the same month, in 1572,
the Calvinists were massacred in Paris and elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the 25th October, 1615, Louis XIII. married
Anne of Austria, infanta of Spain, whereupon we
may remark the following coincidences:&mdash;</p>

<p>The name Loys<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> de Bourbon contains 13 letters;
so does the name Anne d&rsquo;Austriche.</p>

<p>Louis was 13 years old when this marriage was
decided on; Anne was the same age.</p>

<p>He was the thirteenth king of France bearing
the name of Louis, and she was the thirteenth
infanta of the name of Anne of Austria.</p>

<p>On the 23d April, 1616, died Shakspeare: on
the same day of the same month, in the same
year, died the great poet Cervantes.</p>

<p>On the 29th May, 1630, King Charles II. was
born.</p>

the Dutch.</p>

<p>On the 29th May, 1679, the rebellion of the

<p>The Emperor Charles V. was born on February
24, 1500; on that day he won the battle of Pavia,
in 1525, and on the same day was crowned in
1530.</p>

<p>On the 29th January, 1697, M. de Broquemar,
president of the Parliament of Paris, died suddenly
in that city; next day his brother, an officer, died
suddenly at Bergue, where he was governor. The
lives of these brothers present remarkable coincidences.
One day the officer, being engaged in battle,
was wounded in his leg by a sword-blow. On
the same day, at the same moment, the president
was afflicted with acute pain, which attacked him
suddenly in the same leg as that of his brother
which had been injured.</p>

<p>John Aubrey mentions the case of a friend of
his who was born on the 15th November; his
eldest son was born on the 15th November; and
his second son&rsquo;s first son on the same day of the
same month.</p>

At the hour of prime, April 6, 1327, Petrarch
first saw his mistress Laura, in the Church of

<p>The deputation charged with offering the crown
of Greece to Prince Otho, arrived in Munich on
the 13th October, 1832; and it was on the 13th
October, 1862, that King Otho left Athens, to return
to it no more.</p>

<p>On the 21st April, 1770, Louis XVI. was married
at Vienna, by the sending of the ring.</p>

<p>On the 21st June, in the same year, took place
the fatal festivities of his marriage.</p>

<p>On the 21st January, 1781, was the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> at the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, for the birth of the Dauphin.</p>

<p>On the 21st June, 1791, took place the flight to
Varennes.</p>

<p>On the 21st January, 1793, he died on the
scaffold.</p>

<p>There is said to be a tradition of Norman-monkish
origin, that the number 3 is stamped on
the Royal line of England, so that there shall not
be more than three princes in succession without a
revolution.</p>

William I., William II., Henry I.; then followed
the revolution of Stephen.</p>

<p>Henry II., Richard I., John; invasion of Louis,
Dauphin of France, who claimed the throne.</p>

<p>Henry III., Edward I., Edward II., who was
dethroned and put to death.</p>

<p>James I., Charles I.; Revolution.</p>

<p>Charles II., James II.; invasion of William of
Orange.</p>

<p>William of Orange and Mary II., Anne; arrival
of the house of Brunswick.</p>

<p>George I., George II., George III., George IV.,
William IV., Victoria. The law has proved faulty
in the last case; but certainly there was a crisis
in the reign of George IV.</p>

As I am on the subject of the English princes, I
will add another singular coincidence, though it
has nothing to do with the fatality of numbers.</p>

<p>It is that Saturday has been a day of ill omen
to the later kings.</p>

<p>William of Orange died Saturday, 18th March,
1702.</p>

<p>Anne died Saturday, 1st August, 1704.</p>

<p>George I. died Saturday, 10th June, 1727.</p>

<p>George II. died Saturday, 25th October, 1760.</p>

<p>George III. died Saturday, 30th January, 1820.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>The Terrestrial Paradise.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE exact position of Eden, and its present
condition, do not seem to have occupied the
minds of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, nor to have
given rise among them to wild speculations.</p>

<p>The map of the tenth century in the British Museum,
accompanying the Periegesis of Priscian, is
far more correct than the generality of maps which
we find in MSS. at a later period; and Paradise
does not occupy the place of Cochin China, or the
isles of Japan, as it did later, after that the fabulous
voyage of St. Brandan had become popular in the
eleventh century.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The site, however, had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
already indicated by Cosmas, who wrote in the
seventh century, and had been specified by him as
occupying a continent east of China, beyond the
ocean, and still watered by the four great rivers
Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates, which sprang
from subterranean canals. In a map of the ninth
century, preserved in the Strasbourg library, the
terrestrial Paradise is, however, on the Continent,
placed at the extreme east of Asia; in fact, is situated
in the Celestial Empire. It occupies the
same position in a Turin MS., and also in a map
accompanying a commentary on the Apocalypse in
the British Museum.</p>

<p>According to the fictitious letter of Prester John
to the Emperor Emanuel Comnenus, Paradise was
situated close to&mdash;within three days&rsquo; journey of&mdash;his
own territories, but where those territories were,
is not distinctly specified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The River Indus, which issues out of Paradise,&rdquo;
writes the mythical king, &ldquo;flows among the plains,
through a certain province, and it expands, embracing
the whole province with its various windings:
there are found emeralds, sapphires, carbuncles,
topazes, chrysolites, onyx, beryl, sardius, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
other precious stones. There too grows the plant
called Asbetos.&rdquo; A wonderful fountain, moreover,
breaks out at the roots of Olympus, a mountain
in Prester John&rsquo;s domain, and &ldquo;from hour to hour,
and day by day, the taste of this fountain varies;
and its source is hardly three days&rsquo; journey from
Paradise, from which Adam was expelled. If any
man drinks thrice of this spring, he will from that
day feel no infirmity, and he will, as long as he
lives, appear of the age of thirty.&rdquo; This Olympus
is a corruption of Alumbo, which is no other than
Columbo in Ceylon, as is abundantly evident from
Sir John Mandeville&rsquo;s Travels; though this important
fountain has escaped the observation of Sir
Emmerson Tennant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward the heed of that forest (he writes) is
the cytee of Polombe, and above the cytee is a great
mountayne, also clept Polombe. And of that mount,
the Cytee hathe his name. And at the foot of that
Mount is a fayr welle and a gret, that hathe odour
and savour of all spices; and at every hour of the
day, he chaungethe his odour and his savour dyversely.
And whoso drynkethe 3 times fasting of that
watre of that welle, he is hool of alle maner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
sykenesse, that he hathe. And thei that duellen
there and drynken often of that welle, thei nevere
han sykenesse, and thei semen alle weys yonge.
I have dronken there of 3 of 4 sithes; and zit,
methinkethe, I fare the better. Some men clepen
it the Welle of Youthe: for thei that often drynken
thereat, semen alle weys yongly, and lyven withouten
sykenesse. And men seyn, that that welle
comethe out of Paradys: and therefore it is so vertuous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gautier de Metz, in his poem on the &ldquo;Image du
Monde,&rdquo; written in the thirteenth century, places
the terrestrial Paradise in an unapproachable region
of Asia, surrounded by flames, and having an armed
angel to guard the only gate.</p>

<p>Lambertus Floridus, in a MS. of the twelfth century,
preserved in the Imperial Library in Paris,
describes it as &ldquo;Paradisus insula in oceano in
oriente:&rdquo; and in the map accompanying it, Paradise
is represented as an island, a little south-east
of Asia, surrounded by rays, and at some distance
from the main land; and in another MS. of the
same library,&mdash;a medi&aelig;val encyclop&aelig;dia,&mdash;under
the word Paradisus is a passage which states that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
in the centre of Paradise is a fountain which waters
the garden&mdash;that in fact described by Prester John,
and that of which story-telling Sir John Mandeville
declared he had &ldquo;dronken 3 or 4 sithes.&rdquo; Close
to this fountain is the Tree of Life. The temperature
of the country is equable; neither frosts
nor burning heats destroy the vegetation. The four
rivers already mentioned rise in it. Paradise is, however,
inaccessible to the traveller on account of the
wall of fire which surrounds it.</p>

<p>Paludanus relates in his &ldquo;Thesaurus Novus,&rdquo; of
course on incontrovertible authority, that Alexander
the Great was full of desire to see the terrestrial
Paradise, and that he undertook his wars in the
East for the express purpose of reaching it, and
obtaining admission into it. He states that on his
nearing Eden an old man was captured in a ravine
by some of Alexander&rsquo;s soldiers, and they were
about to conduct him to their monarch, when the
venerable man said, &ldquo;Go and announce to Alexander
that it is in vain he seeks Paradise; his efforts
will be perfectly fruitless; for the way of Paradise
is the way of humility, a way of which he knows
nothing. Take this stone and give it to Alexander,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
and say to him, &lsquo;From this stone learn what you
must think of yourself.&rsquo;&rdquo; Now, this stone was of
great value and excessively heavy, outweighing and
excelling in value all other gems; but when reduced
to powder, it was as light as a tuft of hay, and as
worthless. By which token the mysterious old man
meant, that Alexander alive was the greatest of
monarchs, but Alexander dead would be a thing
of nought.</p>

<p>That strangest of medi&aelig;val preachers, Meffreth,
who got into trouble by denying the Immaculate
Conception of the Blessed Virgin, in his second
sermon for the Third Sunday in Advent, discusses
the locality of the terrestrial Paradise, and claims
St. Basil and St. Ambrose as his authorities for
stating that it is situated on the top of a very lofty
mountain in Eastern Asia; so lofty indeed is the
mountain, that the waters of the four rivers fall in
cascade down to a lake at its foot, with such a
roar that the natives who live on the shores of the
lake are stone-deaf. Meffreth also explains the escape
of Paradise from submergence at the Deluge, on the
same grounds as does the Master of Sentences (lib.
2, dist. 17, c. 5), by the mountain being so very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
high that the waters which rose over Ararat were
only able to wash the base of the mountain of
Paradise.</p>

<p>The Hereford map of the thirteenth century represents
the terrestrial Paradise as a circular island
near India, cut off from the continent not only by
the sea, but also by a battlemented wall, with a
gateway to the west.</p>

<p>Rupert of Duytz regards it as having been
situated in Armenia. Radulphus Highden, in the
thirteenth century, relying on the authority of St.
Basil and St. Isidore of Seville, places Eden in an
inaccessible region of Oriental Asia; and this was
also the opinion of Philostorgus. Hugo de St.
Victor, in his book &ldquo;De Situ Terrarum,&rdquo; expresses
himself thus: &ldquo;Paradise is a spot in the
Orient productive of all kind of woods and pomiferous
trees. It contains the Tree of Life: there
is neither cold nor heat there, but perpetual equable
temperature. It contains a fountain which flows
forth in four rivers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rabanus Maurus, with more discretion, says,
&ldquo;Many folk want to make out that the site of
Paradise is in the east of the earth, though cut off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
by the longest intervening space of ocean or earth
from all regions which man now inhabits. Consequently,
the waters of the Deluge, which covered
the highest points of the surface of our orb,
were unable to reach it. However, whether it be
there, or whether it be anywhere else, God knows;
but that there <em>was</em> such a spot once, and that it
was on earth, that is certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jacques de Vitry (&ldquo;Historia Orientalis&rdquo;), Gervais
of Tilbury, in his &ldquo;Otia Imperalia,&rdquo; and
many others, hold the same views, as to the site
of Paradise, that were entertained by Hugo de St.
Victor.</p>

<p>Jourdain de S&egrave;verac, monk and traveller in the
beginning of the fourteenth century, places the
terrestrial Paradise in the &ldquo;Third India;&rdquo; that is
to say, in trans-Gangic India.</p>

<p>Leonardo Dati, a Florentine poet of the fifteenth
century, composed a geographical treatise in verse,
entitled &ldquo;Della Sfera;&rdquo; and it is in Asia that he
locates the garden:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Asia e le prima parte dove l&rsquo;huomo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sendo innocente stava in Paradiso.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But perhaps the most remarkable account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
terrestrial Paradise ever furnished, is that of the
&ldquo;Eireks Saga V&iacute;df&ouml;rla,&rdquo; an Icelandic narrative of
the fourteenth century, giving the adventures of a
certain Norwegian, named Eirek, who had vowed,
whilst a heathen, that he would explore the fabulous
Deathless Land of pagan Scandinavian mythology.
The romance is possibly a Christian recension of an
ancient heathen myth; and Paradise has taken the
place in it of Gl&oelig;sisvellir.</p>

<p>According to the majority of the MSS. the story
purports to be nothing more than a religious novel;
but one audacious copyist has ventured to assert that
it is all fact, and that the details are taken down
from the lips of those who heard them from Eirek
himself. The account is briefly this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Eirek was a son of Thrand, king of Drontheim,
and having taken upon him a vow to explore the
Deathless Land, he went to Denmark, where he
picked up a friend of the same name as himself.
They then went to Constantinople, and called upon
the Emperor, who held a long conversation with
them, which is duly reported, relative to the truths
of Christianity and the site of the Deathless Land,
which, he assures them, is nothing more nor less
than Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
&ldquo;The world,&rdquo; said the monarch, who had not forgotten
his geography since he left school, &ldquo;is precisely
180,000 stages round (about 1,000,000 English
miles), and it is not propped up on posts&mdash;not a
bit!&mdash;it is supported by the power of God; and
the distance between earth and heaven is 100,045
miles (another MS. reads 9382 miles&mdash;the difference
is immaterial); and round about the earth
is a big sea called Ocean.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s to the
south of the earth?&rdquo; asked Eirek. &ldquo;O! there is
the end of the world, and that is India.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
pray where am I to find the Deathless Land?&rdquo;
&ldquo;That lies&mdash;Paradise, I suppose, you mean&mdash;well,
it lies slightly east of India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having obtained this information, the two Eireks
started, furnished with letters from the Greek Emperor.</p>

<p>They traversed Syria, and took ship&mdash;probably
at Balsora; then, reaching India, they proceeded on
their journey on horseback, till they came to a dense
forest, the gloom of which was so great, through
the interlacing of the boughs, that even by day the
stars could be observed twinkling, as though they
were seen from the bottom of a well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
On emerging from the forest, the two Eireks came
upon a strait, separating them from a beautiful land,
which was unmistakably Paradise; and the Danish
Eirek, intent on displaying his scriptural knowledge,
pronounced the strait to be the River Pison. This
was crossed by a stone bridge, guarded by a dragon.</p>

<p>The Danish Eirek, deterred by the prospect of
an encounter with this monster, refused to advance,
and even endeavored to persuade his friend to give
up the attempt to enter Paradise as hopeless, after
that they had come within sight of the favored land.
But the Norseman deliberately walked, sword in
hand, into the maw of the dragon, and next moment,
to his infinite surprise and delight, found himself
liberated from the gloom of the monster&rsquo;s interior,
and safely placed in Paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land was most beautiful, and the grass as
gorgeous as purple; it was studded with flowers,
and was traversed by honey rills. The land was
extensive and level, so that there was not to be
seen mountain or hill, and the sun shone cloudless,
without night and darkness; the calm of the air
was great, and there was but a feeble murmur of
wind, and that which there was, breathed redolent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
with the odor of blossoms.&rdquo; After a short walk,
Eirek observed what certainly must have been a
remarkable object, namely, a tower or steeple self-suspended
in the air, without any support whatever,
though access might be had to it by means of a
slender ladder. By this Eirek ascended into a loft
of the tower, and found there an excellent cold collation
prepared for him. After having partaken of
this he went to sleep, and in vision beheld and
conversed with his guardian angel, who promised
to conduct him back to his fatherland, but to come
for him again and fetch him away from it forever
at the expiration of the tenth year after his return
to Dronheim.</p>

<p>Eirek then retraced his steps to India, unmolested
by the dragon, which did not affect any surprise at
having to disgorge him, and, indeed, which seems
to have been, notwithstanding his looks, but a harmless
and passive dragon.</p>

<p>After a tedious journey of seven years, Eirek
reached his native land, where he related his adventures,
to the confusion of the heathen, and to
the delight and edification of the faithful. &ldquo;And
in the tenth year, and at break of day, as Eirek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
went to prayer, God&rsquo;s Spirit caught him away, and
he was never seen again in this world: so here
ends all we have to say of him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>The saga, of which I have given the merest outline,
is certainly striking, and contains some beautiful
passages. It follows the commonly-received
opinion which identified Paradise with Ceylon;
and, indeed, an earlier Icelandic work, the &ldquo;Rymbegla,&rdquo;
indicates the locality of the terrestrial Paradise
as being near India, for it speaks of the Ganges
as taking its rise in the mountains of Eden. It is
not unlikely that the curious history of Eirek, if not
a Christianized version of a heathen myth, may
contain the tradition of a real expedition to India,
by one of the hardy adventurers who overran Europe,
explored the north of Russia, harrowed the
shores of Africa, and discovered America.</p>

<p>Later than the fifteenth century, we find no theories
propounded concerning the terrestrial Paradise,
though there are many treatises on the presumed
situation of the ancient Eden. At Madrid was
published a poem on the subject, entitled &ldquo;Patriana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
decas,&rdquo; in 1629. In 1662 G.&nbsp;C. Kirchmayer, a Wittemberg
professor, composed a thoughtful dissertation,
&ldquo;De Paradiso,&rdquo; which he inserted in his &ldquo;Delici&aelig;
&AElig;stiv&aelig;.&rdquo; Fr. Arnoulx wrote a work on
Paradise in 1665, full of the grossest absurdities.
In 1666 appeared Carver&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discourse on the Terrestrian
Paradise.&rdquo; Bochart composed a tract on
the subject; Huet wrote on it also, and his work
passed through seven editions, the last dated from
Amsterdam, 1701. The P&egrave;re Hardouin composed
a &ldquo;Nouveau Trait&eacute; de la Situation du Paradis Terrestre,&rdquo;
La Haye, 1730. An Armenian work on the
rivers of Paradise was translated by M. Saint Marten
in 1819; and in 1842 Sir W. Ouseley read a paper
on the situation of Eden, before the Literary Society
in London.</p>

<p class="padtop">&ldquo;The diversified contents of this volume can hardly fail to gain for it a wide
perusal. It has the interest, in a greater or less degree, of history and romance;
of truth stranger than fiction; of personal sketches; of the curious phases of an
exceptional social life; of singular admixtures of piety and folly, of greatness and
profligacy, fidelity and intrigue, all mingling or revealed in connection with the
prolonged career of one who was, in certain respects, the most remarkable woman
of her time.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;With nothing like the talents which immortalized the author of <i>Corinne</i>,
Madame R&eacute;camier won herself a place of not less social influence among the men
and women of her day. We must clearly look elsewhere than either to intellect,
wealth, beauty, or all three combined, for the secret of that witchery which was so
distinctive of her. There was something, we are led to infer, in her constitutional
temperament, which, even beyond her delicate and indefinable tact, may afford the
real clew to much of her mysterious ascendency. Love seems to have existed in
her as a yearning of the soul almost entirely free from those elements of passion
which are grounded in the difference of the sexes. There was in it not so much of
the desire which centres in a single object, as of the emotion which seeks to diffuse
itself over the very widest sphere of objects. It could thus be warm and deep,
while pure and inaccessible to evil. Sainte-Beuve&rsquo;s remark, that she had carried
the art of friendship to perfection, helps us here to give the true key to her character.
A warm and constant friend, she never admitted, never showed herself, a
lover. Satisfied with the arrangement which gave her from an early age nothing
more than the name and status of a wife, she could let her natural affection range
with freedom and security wherever it met with a response that left intact her
dignity and self-respect. Such coquetry as she showed arose rather from an
instinctive desire to please and attract, than from anything approaching to a
vicious instinct, or a silly desire to swell the list of her conquests. What seemed
to begin in flirtation never went to the point of danger, and men who at first sight
loved her passionately usually ended by becoming her true friends.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The London
Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Archaic spelling is preserved as printed. Variable spelling is also preserved as
printed, where both forms are recognised; for example, Gervase/Gervais of Tilbury,
Sir John Mandeville/Maundevil.</p>

<p>Unk-Khan is given as another name for Prester John. There is one instance of Un-Khan;
however, this is in quoted material, and so is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_46">46</a> includes the phrase, "it was Saterday in Wyttson woke"; the
word 'woke' may be a typographic error for 'weke', but as it cannot
be ascertained for certain, it is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>At page <a href="#Page_118">118</a>, Hemingr is described as throwing a spear rather than
shooting an arrow as challenged. This is presumably an error in the story, but
is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_168">168</a> includes "He will rebuild the temple at Jerusalem, and making
the Holy City the great capital of the world." The 'and making' may be
an error for 'and make' or simply 'making'; as it is impossible to be
sure, it is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired. Hyphenation and accent usage have
been made consistent.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
